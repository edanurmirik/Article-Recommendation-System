# Article Recommendation System

 This project provides personalized academic paper recommendations using Python Django for web programming, NLP, and machine learning models like fastText and SciBERT.

 ## Technologies

 - Web Programming (Django): A web platform built with Python Django allows users to register, set interests, and receive dynamic recommendations.
 - NLP: NLTK is used for text preprocessing (removing stop words, punctuation, stemming) to analyze paper content.
 - FastText & SciBERT: These models generate vector representations of articles and user profiles for better matching based on content.
 - Cosine Similarity: Measures similarity between user interests and paper vectors to recommend relevant papers.
 - Feedback & Personalization: User feedback updates recommendations, making them more tailored to individual preferences.
 - Performance Evaluation: Precision is calculated to show how well the system matches user interests.
