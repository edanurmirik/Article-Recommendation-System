feldkamp type image reconstruction equiangular datum 
 cone beam approach image reconstruction attract increase attention 
	 application especially medical imaging previously 
	 traditional practical cone beam reconstruction method feldkamp 
	 algorithm generalize case spiral helical scanning 
	 loci equispatial cone beam projection datum paper 
	 formulate generalized feldkamp algorithm case 
	 equiangular cone beam projection datum perform numerical 
	 simulation evaluate image quality medical 
	 multi slice cone beam ct scanner typically use equiangular projection 
	 datum new formula useful area framework 
	 far refinement benchmark comparison
