characterization sheet buckle subject control boundary constraint 
 wedge strip test design study onset post buckling behavior 
	 sheet boundary constraint device easily 
	 incorporate conventional tensile test machine material 
	 resistance buckling measure buckling height versus 
	 plane strain state design yield different consistent 
	 buckle mode easy change boundary condition clamp 
	 free sample geometry experimental result use 
	 verify hybrid approach buckle prediction i.e. combination 
	 fem analysis energy base analytical wrinkling criterion 
	 fem analysis use obtain stress field deform 
	 geometry complex form condition analytical solution 
	 provide prediction sensitive artificial numerical 
	 parameter good agreement experimental datum numerical 
	 prediction obtain
