sensing control double sided arc welding process 
 welding industry drive improve productivity sacrifice 
	 quality thick material welding current practice use 
	 backing multiple pass laser welding process capable 
	 achieve deep narrow penetration significantly improve welding 
	 productivity application reduce number pass 
	 competitiveness comparison traditional arc welding 
	 weaken high cost strict fit requirement difficulty 
	 weld large structure work different method refer 
	 double sided arc welding dsaw develop improve arc 
	 concentration arc welding sensing control system 
	 develop achieve deep narrow penetration variation 
	 welding condition experiment verify pulse keyhole dsaw 
	 system develop capable achieve deep narrow penetration 
	 1/2 inch thick square butt joint single pass
