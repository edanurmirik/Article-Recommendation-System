 imaging application highly desirable replace mechanical 
	 beam steering component i.e. mirror gimbal 
	 nonmechanical device device nematic liquid crystal 
	 optical phase array lcopa lcopa implement blaze phase 
	 grate steer incident light phase grating 
	 use broadband imaging system adverse effect occur 
	 dispersion cause different incident wavelength arrive 
	 angle steer different output angle cause 
	 chromatic aberration image plane second device steer 
	 energy diffraction order 
	 multiple order effect result multiple copy scene 
	 appear image plane describe digital image restoration 
	 technique design overcome degradation propose 
	 postprocessing technique base wiener deconvolution filter 
	 technique applicable scene contain object 
	 approximately constant reflectivity spectral region 
	 interest experimental result present demonstrate
