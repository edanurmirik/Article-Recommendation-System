design pid controller desire time domain frequency domain response 
 practical requirement design control system especially process 
	 control system usually specify term time domain 
	 response overshoot rise time frequency domain 
	 response resonance peak stability margin 
	 numerous method develop design 
	 proportional integral derivative pid controller little work 
	 relation quantitative time domain frequency domain 
	 response paper study following problem 
	 nominal stable process time delay design suboptimal pid 
	 controller achieve required time domain response 
	 frequency domain response nominal system uncertain 
	 system h sub infinity pid controller develop base 
	 optimal control theory parameter derive analytically 
	 property investigate compare develop 
	 suboptimal controller h sub 2/ pid controller maclaurin pid
