elimination zero order diffraction digital holography 
 simple method suppress zero order diffraction reconstructed 
	 image digital holography present method laplacian 
	 detect hologram use instead hologram 
	 numerical reconstruction compute discrete fresnel integral 
	 method significantly improve image quality 
	 resolution high accuracy reconstructed image main 
	 advantage method simplicity experimental 
	 requirement convenience datum processing
