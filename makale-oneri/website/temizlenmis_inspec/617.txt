estimation trifocal tensor use gmm 
 novel estimation trifocal tensor base gaussian mixture model 
	 gmm present mixture model build assume 
	 residual inlier outlier belong different gaussian 
	 distribution bayesian rule employ detect inlier 
	 estimation experiment present method 
	 precise relatively unaffected outlier
