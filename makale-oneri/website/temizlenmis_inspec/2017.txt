autofocus system microscope 
 technique develop microscope autofocusing 
	 eccentric light beam approach high resolution wide focus 
	 range compact construction principle describe 
	 theoretical formula eccentric light beam approach deduce 
	 apply object lens objective plane 
	 focal plane object lens objective plane 
	 focal plane experimental setup use semiconductor laser 
	 device light source laser beam enter 
	 microscope eccentric main light axis defocused signal 
	 acquire symmetrical silicon photocell change 
	 reflect light position cause differential amplification 
	 process microprocessor electric signal 
	 power amplify drive dc motor fine work 
	 platform automatic focus microscope result 
	 experiment or-0.1- mu m precision autofocuse range 
	 or-500- mu m defocuse system high reliability 
	 meet requirement accurate micro measurement system
