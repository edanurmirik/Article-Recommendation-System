construction boolean algebra 
 construct boolean algebra prescribed behaviour concern depth 
	 free product boolean algebra zfc use 
	 pcf assume square result ultraproduct deal 
	 family cardinality topological density homomorphic 
	 image boolean algebras translate topology 
	 cardinality closed subspace lastly deal 
	 inequality cardinal invariant mainly d(b)/sup kappa 
	 /<|b| imply ind(b)>/sup kappa /v depth(b)>or log(|b|
