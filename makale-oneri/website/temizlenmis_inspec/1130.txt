node capacitate ring route 
 consider node capacitate routing problem undirected ring network 
	 fractional relaxation node capacitate 
	 multicommodity flow problem feasibility problem farkas lemma 
	 provide characterization general undirected graph assert 
	 roughly exist flow 
	 distance inequality hold choice distance function 
	 arise nonnegative node weight ring 
	 straightforward result improve way prove 
	 independent integrality node capacity suffice 
	 require distance inequality distance arise 
	 0 1 2)-valued node weight requirement 
	 double cut condition integer value node capacity 
	 double cut condition imply existence half integral 
	 multicommodity flow case integer value 
	 multicommodity flow violate node capacity 
	 approach rise combinatorial strongly polynomial 
	 algorithm compute violate double cut 
	 node capacitate multicommodity flow relation problem 
	 edge capacitate counterpart explain
