formal model correctness cadastre 
 key issue cadastral system maintenance correctness 
	 correctness define proper correspondence 
	 valid legal situation content cadastre 
	 correspondence generally difficult achieve cadastre 
	 complete representation aspect influence legal 
	 situation reality goal paper develop formal 
	 model comprise representation cadastre reality 
	 allow simulation investigation case 
	 correspondence potentially violate purpose model 
	 consist represent valid legal 
	 situation second represent cadastre 
	 feasible mark difference reality cadastre 
	 mark model facilitate 
	 discussion issue real world cadastral system 
	 incorrectness occur order develop formal model paper 
	 use transfer ownership parcel person 
	 minimal case study foundation formalization modern 
	 version situation calculus focus analysis 
	 cadastre preparation conceptual formalized model 
	 implementation prototype
