speaker identification voice use neural network 
 paper provide different scheme speaker identification 
	 personnel voice use artificial neural network 
	 scheme recognize speaker employ classical backpropagation 
	 algorithm pre train know voice sample person 
	 second scheme provide framework classify know training 
	 sample voice feature use hierarchical architecture 
	 realize self organize feature map neural net 
	 scheme highly robust capable identify personnel 
	 noisy voice sample excessive training 
	 time limit application large voice database second 
	 scheme robust classify 
	 unknown voice sample near class time need 
	 classification scheme unique irrespective 
	 voice sample proportional number feedforward layer 
	 network time requirement second classification scheme 
	 free voice feature proportional 
	 number 2d array traverse algorithm hierarchical 
	 structure scheme highly robust mis classification 
	 low 0.2 cent scheme combine composite 
	 benefit radial basis function neural net backpropagation 
	 train neural net
