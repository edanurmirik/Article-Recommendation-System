fidelity quantum teleportation noisy channel 
 investigate quantum teleportation noisy quantum channel solve 
	 analytically numerically master equation lindblad form 
	 calculate fidelity function decoherence rate angle 
	 state teleport find average fidelity 
	 range state accurately teleport depend type noise 
	 act quantum channel quantum channel subject 
	 isotropic noise average fidelity decay 1/2 small 
	 good possible value 2/3 obtain classical 
	 communication hand noisy quantum channel 
	 model single lindblad operator average fidelity 
	 great 2/3
