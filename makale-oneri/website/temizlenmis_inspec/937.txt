use neural network analysis particle size distribution laser 
	 diffraction test different particle system 
 application forward light scatter method estimate particle 
	 size distribution psd usually limit occurrence 
	 multiple scattering affect angular distribution light 
	 highly concentrated suspension result false calculation 
	 conventionally adopt algorithm paper previously 
	 propose neural network base method test different particle 
	 system order evaluate applicability step 
	 study experiment carry solid liquid suspension 
	 different characteristic particle shape size 
	 distribution vary solid concentration experimental 
	 result consist angular distribution light intensity 
	 particle shape suspension concentration use input datum 
	 fitting neural network model nn replace optical 
	 model provide psd reference value particle shape 
	 psd nn fitting base image analysis comparison 
	 psd value compute nn model reference 
	 value indicate method use monitor psd 
	 particle different shape highly concentrated suspension 
	 extend range application forward laser diffraction 
	 number system industrial interest
