training multilayer perceptron minimization sum ridge function 
 motivate problem training multilayer perceptron neural network 
	 consider problem minimize e(x)= sigma /sub i=1//sup n/ 
	 f sub i/ xi /sub i/.x xi /sub i/ r sup s/ 
	 1 n f sub i/ xi /sub i/.x ridge 
	 function n small problem minimize e 
	 treat minimize univariate function use 
	 gradient algorithm minimize e n moderately large 
	 large n present online gradient algorithm especially 
	 monotonicity weak convergence algorithm
