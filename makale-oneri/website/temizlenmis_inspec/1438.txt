 dimensional 3d particle image tracking technique use study 
	 coarse spherical particle liquid flow pipe flow image 
	 view normal view reflect 
	 view mirror record ccd camera 
	 digitize pc image grabber card image processing 
	 program develop enhance segment flow image 
	 identify particle 90 particle 
	 identify locate partially overlap particle image 
	 use circular hough transform 3d position 
	 detect particle determine match view image 
	 view image particle velocity obtain pair 
	 image successive video field measurement 
	 spherical expand polystyrene particle oil flow 
	 particle like spherical bubble laminar bubbly flow tend 
	 conglomerate near pipe wall line form particle 
	 cluster liquid velocity decrease particle cluster disperse 
	 particle distribute pipe centre region
