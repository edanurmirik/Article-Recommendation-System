approximate relaxed descent method optimal control problem 
 consider optimal control problem system govern ordinary 
	 differential equation control constraint convexity 
	 assumption datum problem reformulate 
	 relaxed form relaxed state equation discretize implicit 
	 trapezoidal scheme relaxed control approximate 
	 piecewise constant relaxed control propose combine descent 
	 discretization method generate sequence discrete relaxed 
	 control progressively refine discretization 
	 adjoint discrete state equation define use 
	 iteration approximate derivative cost functional define 
	 discretize continuous adjoint equation integral involve 
	 appropriate trapezoidal scheme prove accumulation 
	 point sequence construct method satisfy strong 
	 relaxed necessary condition optimality continuous problem 
	 finally compute relaxed control easily approximate 
	 piecewise constant classical control
