multispectral color image capture use liquid crystal tunable filter 
 describe experimental setup multispectral color image acquisition 
	 system consist professional monochrome ccd camera tunable 
	 filter spectral transmittance control 
	 electronically perform spectral characterization 
	 acquisition system account acquisition noise 
	 convert camera output signal device independent color datum 
	 main approach propose evaluate consist apply 
	 regression method convert k camera output 
	 device independent color space ciexyz cielab method 
	 base spectral model acquisition system invert 
	 model use principal eigenvector approach estimate 
	 spectral reflectance pixel image surface
