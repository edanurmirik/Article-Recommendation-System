novel active noise reduce headset use earshell vibration control 
 active noise reduce anr headset available commercially application 
	 vary aviation communication consumer audio current anr 
	 system use passive attenuation high frequency 
	 loudspeaker base active noise control low frequency achieve 
	 broadband noise reduction paper present novel anr headset 
	 external noise transmit user ear earshell 
	 vibration reduce control vibration earshell use 
	 force actuator act inertial mass earshell 
	 headband model base theoretical analysis use velocity feedback 
	 control current piezoelectric actuator provide sufficient 
	 force require low stiffness improve low frequency 
	 performance control simulation base experimental datum 
	 laboratory headset good performance potentially 
	 achieve practice robust feedback controller 
	 single frequency real time control experiment verify noise 
	 reduction achieve use earshell vibration control
