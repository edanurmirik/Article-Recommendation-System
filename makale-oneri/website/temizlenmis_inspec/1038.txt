analysis control longitudinal vibration wave viewpoint 
 analysis control longitudinal vibration rod feedback wave 
	 viewpoint synthesize collocate noncollocate feedback 
	 wave control strategy explore control design base 
	 local property wave transmission reflection 
	 vicinity control force apply area complex 
	 closed form solution involve controller design achieve 
	 goal absorb incoming vibration energy 
	 create vibration free zone eliminate stand wave 
	 structure finding appear useful practice 
	 simplicity implementation controller
