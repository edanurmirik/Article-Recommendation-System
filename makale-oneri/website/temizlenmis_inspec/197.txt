mixture expert classification use hierarchical mixture model 
 level hierarchical mixture model classification present 
	 model follow data generation process 1 datum 
	 generate finite number source cluster 2 
	 generation mechanism source assume existence individual 
	 internal class label source subcluster external cluster 
	 model estimate posterior probability class membership 
	 similar mixture expert classifier order learn 
	 parameter model develop general training approach 
	 base maximum likelihood result efficient training 
	 algorithm compare classification mixture model 
	 propose hierarchical model exhibit advantage provide 
	 improve classification performance indicate experimental 
	 result
