lmi approach digital redesign linear time invariant system 
 simple design methodology digital redesign static state feedback 
	 controller use linear matrix inequality present 
	 propose method provide close matching state 
	 original continuous time system digitally redesign 
	 system guarantee stability specifically digital redesign 
	 problem reformulate linear matrix inequality lmis solve 
	 numerical optimisation technique main feature propose 
	 method closed loop stability digitally redesign 
	 system explicitly guarantee design procedure use 
	 lmi base approach numerical example position control 
	 simple crane system present
