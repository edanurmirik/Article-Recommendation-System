column generation approach delivery planning time inhomogeneous 
	 service provider service interval constraint 
 consider problem delivery planning multiple time period 
	 delivery customer nominate demand 
	 time period demand meet time period use 
	 combination inhomogeneous service provider service provider 
	 different delivery capacity different cost delivery 
	 customer different utilisation requirement different rule 
	 govern spread delivery time problem plan 
	 delivery minimise overall cost subject demand meet 
	 service rule obey natural integer programming model find 
	 intractable problem loose demand constraint 
	 gap lower bound good feasible solution
