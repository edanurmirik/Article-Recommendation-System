	 pearlman 1996 set partition hierarchical tree spiht 
	 algorithm know simplicity efficiency paper 
	 deal real time implementation spiht algorithm use dsp 
	 chip order facilitate implementation improve codec 
	 performance relative issue thoroughly discuss 
	 optimization program structure speed wavelet 
	 decomposition spiht high memory requirement major drawback 
	 hardware implementation paper modify original spiht 
	 algorithm present new concept number error bit 
	 absolute zerotree consequently memory cost significantly 
	 reduced introduce new method control code process 
	 number error bit experimental result 
	 implementation meet common requirement real time video coding 
	 prove practical efficient dsp solution
