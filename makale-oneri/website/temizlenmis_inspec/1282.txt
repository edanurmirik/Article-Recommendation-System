completeness time mu crl 
 previously straightforward extension process algebra mu crl 
	 propose explicitly deal time process algebra mu crl 
	 especially design deal datum process algebraic 
	 context use feature datum minor extension 
	 language need obtain expressive variant time 
	 previously contain syntax operational semantic axiom 
	 characterise time mu crl contain depth analysis 
	 theory time mu crl paper fill gap provide 
	 soundness completeness result main tool establish 
	 mapping time untimed mu crl employ completeness 
	 result obtain untimed mu crl
