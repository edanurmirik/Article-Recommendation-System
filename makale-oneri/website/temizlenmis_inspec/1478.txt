 laboratory study conduct determine effect work pace 
	 type force electromyographic emg activity subjective 
	 discomfort find participant type fast typing 
	 force finger flexor extensor emg activity increase linearly 
	 increase subjective discomfort sharp 
	 threshold participant self select pace maximum 
	 type speed result suggest participant self select 
	 type pace maximize type speed minimizes discomfort 
	 fast typist produce significantly finger flexor emg 
	 activity produce proportionately finger extensor emg 
	 activity compare slow typist hypothesize fast 
	 typist use different muscle recruitment pattern allow 
	 efficient slow typist strike key 
	 addition fast typist experience discomfort slow 
	 typist finding relative pace typing 
	 important actual typing speed regard discomfort muscle 
	 activity result suggest typist benefit skill 
	 training increase maximum typing speed potential application 
	 research include skill training typist
