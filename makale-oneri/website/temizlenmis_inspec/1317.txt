dynamic spectrum management generation dsl system 
 performance dsl system severely constrain crosstalk 
	 electromagnetic coupling multiple twisted pair 
	 phone cable order reduce performance loss arise 
	 crosstalk dsl system currently design assumption 
	 bad case crosstalk scenario lead overly conservative dsl 
	 deployment article present new paradigm dsl system 
	 design account multi user aspect dsl 
	 transmission environment dynamic spectrum management dsm depart 
	 current design philosophy enable transceiver 
	 autonomously dynamically optimize communication setting 
	 respect channel transmission neighboring 
	 system distribute optimization additional 
	 degree coordination available future dsl deployment dsm 
	 allow great improvement dsl performance implementation 
	 readily applicable cause performance degradation 
	 exist dsl static spectrum management provide
