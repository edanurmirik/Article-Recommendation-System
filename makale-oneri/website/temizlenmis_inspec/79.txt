efficient stable ray trace algorithm parametric surface 
 paper propose efficient stable algorithm find 
	 ray surface intersection newton method bezier clip 
	 adapt form core algorithm ray coherence use 
	 find start point newton iteration introduce obstruction 
	 detection technique verify intersection point find use 
	 newton method close newton method fail achieve 
	 convergence use bezier clip substitution find 
	 intersection point combination achieve significant 
	 improvement trace primary ray similar approach successfully 
	 improve performance trace secondary ray
