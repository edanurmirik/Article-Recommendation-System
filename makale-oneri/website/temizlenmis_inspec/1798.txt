robustness evaluation minimal rbf neural network 
	 nonlinear data storage channel equalisation 
 author present performance robustness evaluation recently 
	 develop minimal resource allocation network mran equalisation 
	 highly nonlinear magnetic recording channel disc storage 
	 system unlike communication system equalisation signal 
	 channel difficult problem corrupt 
	 data dependent noise highly nonlinear distortion nair moon 
	 1997 propose maximum signal distortion ratio msdr 
	 equaliser datum storage channel use specially design 
	 neural network parameter neural network 
	 determine theoretically base exact knowledge channel 
	 model parameter present paper performance msdr 
	 equaliser compare mran equaliser use magnetic 
	 recording channel model condition include variation 
	 partial erasure jitter width noise power model 
	 mismatch result study indicate complex mran 
	 equaliser consistently performance robustness 
	 msdr equaliser term signal distortion ratio sdrs
