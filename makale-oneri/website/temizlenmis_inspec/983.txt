limitation delayed state feedback numerical study 
 stabilization class linear time delay system achieve 
	 numerical procedure continuous pole placement method 
	 michiels et al 2000 method extension 
	 classical pole placement algorithm ordinary differential equation 
	 class delay differential equation michiels et al 2000 
	 apply stabilization linear time invariant system 
	 input delay use static state feedback paper study 
	 limitation delayed state feedback law precisely 
	 completely characterize class stabilizable plant 
	 2d case purpose use numerical continuation 
	 technique use delay state feedback control 
	 application effect limitation briefly discuss
