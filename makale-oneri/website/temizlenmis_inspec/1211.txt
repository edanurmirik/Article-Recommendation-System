	 far distinguish training example fall leaf node 
	 diversity diversity threshold node 
	 mark dummy node dummy node mark 
	 specific feedforward neural network fannc train 
	 instance space define original order attribute exploit

	 kind incremental learning task incremental learning 
	 procedure design example incremental learning different 
	 storage requirement provide enable hdt deal gracefully 
	 datum set new datum frequently append 
	 hypothesis drive constructive induction mechanism provide
