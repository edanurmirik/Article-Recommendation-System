computational complexity probabilistic disambiguation 
 recent model natural language processing employ statistical reasoning 
	 deal ambiguity formal grammar approach 
	 statistic concern linguistic phenomenon interest 
	 gather actual linguistic datum use estimate 
	 probability entity generate 
	 grammar e.g. derivation parse tree sentence extension 
	 grammar probability possible state ambiguity 
	 resolution constrained optimization formula aim 
	 maximize probability entity grammar generate 
	 input e.g. maximum probability parse tree input 
	 sentence implementation optimization formulae 
	 efficient algorithm proceed smoothly 
	 paper address computational complexity ambiguity 
	 resolution kind probabilistic model provide 
	 proof frequently occur problem ambiguity resolution 
	 np complete problem encounter 
	 application e.g. language understanding textand speech base 
	 application assume common model computation result 
	 imply exist probabilistic model possible 
	 devise tractable algorithm solve optimization problem
