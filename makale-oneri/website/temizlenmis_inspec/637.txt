digital fountain approach asynchronous reliable multicast 
 proliferation application reliably distribute large rich 
	 content vast number autonomous receiver motivate design 
	 new multicast broadcast protocol describe ideal fully 
	 scalable protocol application digital 
	 fountain digital fountain allow number heterogeneous 
	 receiver acquire content optimal efficiency time 
	 choosing feedback channel need ensure reliable 
	 delivery face high loss rate develop protocol 
	 closely approximate digital fountain use new class 
	 erasure code large block size order magnitude fast 
	 standard erasure code provide performance measurement 
	 demonstrate feasibility approach discuss design 
	 implementation performance experimental system
