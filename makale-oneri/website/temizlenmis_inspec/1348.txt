 present new method surface reconstruction generate smooth 
	 seamless model sparse noisy nonuniform low resolution 
	 range datum datum acquisition technique computer vision 
	 stereo range image space carving produce 3d point set 
	 imprecise nonuniform compare laser optical range 
	 scanner traditional reconstruction algorithm design dense 
	 precise datum produce smooth reconstruction apply 
	 vision base data set method construct 3d implicit surface 
	 formulate sum weight radial basis function achieve 
	 primary advantage exist algorithm 1 implicit 
	 function construct estimate surface region 
	 little datum 2 reconstructed surface insensitive noise 
	 datum acquisition allow surface approximate 
	 exactly interpolate datum 3 reconstructed 
	 surface locally detail globally smooth use radial 
	 basis function achieve multiple order smoothness
