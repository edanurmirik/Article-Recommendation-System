develop high performance web server concurrent haskell 
 server application particular network base server application place 
	 unique combination demand programming language lightweight 
	 concurrency high o throughput fault tolerance 
	 important paper describe prototype web server write 
	 concurrent haskell extension present useful result 
	 firstly conform server write minimal effort 
	 lead implementation 1500 line code 
	 secondly naive implementation produce reasonable performance 
	 furthermore minor modification time critical 
	 component improve performance level acceptable 
	 heavily load web server
