continuous time linear system folklore fact 
 consider family continuous input output map represent linear 
	 time invariant system set signal 
	 family contain map impulse response zero 
	 function certain input nonzero output 
	 family contain member input output 
	 property describe frequency domain response 
	 function map consider need commute
