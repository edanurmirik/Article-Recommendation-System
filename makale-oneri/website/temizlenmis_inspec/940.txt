tool analysis dose optimization i. effect volume histogram 
 advent dose optimization algorithm predominantly 
	 intensity modulate radiotherapy imrt computer software 
	 progress point merely tool hand 
	 expert active independent mediator dosimetric 
	 conflict treatment goal risk understand control 
	 internal decision finding provide mean influence 
	 tool analysis dose distribution present 
	 reveal decision process perform algorithm 
	 internal trade partial volume receive high low dose 
	 drive function attribute weight volume 
	 element statistic distribution weight cast 
	 effect volume histogram evh analogy dose volume 
	 histogram analysis evh reveal trait optimum 
	 dose distribution result define objective 
	 random consequence under- misspecification treatment goal 
	 evh far assist process find suitable 
	 objective balance conflict objective biologically 
	 inspire objective use evh distribution local 
	 dose effect relative prescribed level
