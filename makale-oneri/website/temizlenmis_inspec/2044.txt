dimensional geometrical optic code indoor propagation 
 paper present program 3d compute field transmitter 
	 indoor environment use geometrical optic program use 
	 image tree datum structure construct image need compute 
	 ray carry field preset threshold value 
	 matter reflection need paper briefly describe 
	 input file require define wall construction floor plan 
	 transmitter receiver location case study consist 
	 long corridor small room use demonstrate 
	 feature 3d program
