effective cast shadow detection monocular color traffic image 
	 sequence 
 accurate scene analysis use monocular color traffic image sequence 
	 robust segmentation vehicle stationary background 
	 generally require presence cast shadow 
	 lead inaccurate vehicle segmentation result lead 
	 erroneous scene analysis propose effective method 
	 detection cast shadow observe characteristic 
	 cast shadow luminance chrominance gradient density 
	 geometry domain combine probability map shadow 
	 confidence score scs obtain edge map input 
	 image edge pixel examine determine belong 
	 vehicle region base neighboring scs cast shadow 
	 identify region high scs outside 
	 convex hull select vehicle edge pixel propose method 
	 test 100 vehicle image different lighting condition 
	 sunny cloudy view angle roadside overhead vehicle 
	 size small medium large color similar road 
	 result indicate average error rate 14 
	 obtain low error rate 3 large vehicle
