	 open window room propose traffic noise transmit 
	 room generally dominate low frequency component 
	 active noise control anc technology find application 
	 good coherence reference error signal essential 
	 effective noise reduction check base traffic 
	 noise prediction method wave theory mode coupling theory 
	 result paper enable determine potential
