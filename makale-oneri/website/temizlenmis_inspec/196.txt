emergence rule neural network 
 simple associationist neural network learn factor abstract rule i.e. 
	 grammar sequence arbitrary input symbol invent 
	 abstract representation accommodate unseen symbol set 
	 unseen similar grammar neural network 
	 ability transfer grammatical knowledge new symbol 
	 vocabulary new grammar analysis state space 
	 network learn generalized abstract structure input 
	 simply memorize input string representation 
	 context sensitive hierarchical base state variable 
	 finite state machine neural network learn 
	 generalization new symbol set grammar arise spatial 
	 nature internal representation use network allow 
	 new symbol set encode close symbol set 
	 learn hidden unit space network result 
	 counter argument learn algorithm base weight 
	 adaptation exemplar presentation long term 
	 potentiation find mammalian nervous system principle 
	 extract symbolic knowledge positive example prescribe 
	 prevail human linguistic theory evolutionary psychology
