resolution current mode algorithmic analog digital converter 
 error limit resolution current mode algorithmic analog digital 
	 converter mainly relate current mirror operation 
	 systematic error minimize proper circuit technique random 
	 source unavoidable paper statistical analysis 
	 resolution typical converter carry account 
	 process tolerance support analysis 4 bit adc realize 
	 0.35- mu m cmos technology exhaustively simulate result 
	 find excellent agreement theoretical derivation
