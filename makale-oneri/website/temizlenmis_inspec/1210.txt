adaptive optimize compiler 21st century 
 historically compiler operate apply fix set optimization 
	 predetermine order order list optimization 
	 compilation sequence paper describe prototype system 
	 use bias random search discover program specific compilation 
	 sequence minimize explicit external objective function 
	 result compiler framework adapt behavior 
	 application compile pool available transformation 
	 objective function target machine paper 
	 describe experiment attempt characterize space 
	 adaptive compiler search preliminary result suggest 
	 optimal solution rare local minima frequent 
	 hold true biased random search genetic algorithm 
	 find good solution quickly simple strategy hill 
	 climbing
