differential integral calculus discrete time series datum 
 find discontinuity play crucial role natural evolution 
	 lin 1998 presentation generalize idea 
	 integration differentiation develop calculus study 
	 time series hope problem outlier 
	 discontinuity resolve successfully simply delete 
	 outlier avoid discontinuity overall data 
	 analysis general appearance outlier tend mean existence 
	 discontinuity explosive growth decline evolution 
	 time approach employ partially overcome 
	 problem data value available time series 
	 end look real life problem prediction 
	 order power new approach
