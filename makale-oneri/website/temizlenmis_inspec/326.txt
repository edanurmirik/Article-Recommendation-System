	 horse compare abstract scenario use previously 
	 group learner receive different advice include 
	 combination 1 explicit instruction concern optimal 
	 strategy 2 explicit instruction concern monetary sum 
	 maximize 3 accurate information concern probability 
	 event result minimal effect horse race versus 
	 abstract scenario advice concern optimal strategy 
	 probability information contribute significantly performance
