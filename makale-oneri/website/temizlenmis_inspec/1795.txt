 author propose voice internet protocol voip technique new 
	 hierarchical datum security protection hdsp scheme propose hdsp 
	 scheme maintain voice quality degrade packet loss 
	 preserve high datum security perform datum inter leave 
	 inter frame voice achieve error recovery voice 
	 suffer continuous packet loss datum encryption 
	 intra frame voice achieve high datum security 
	 control random bit string sequence generate chaotic 
	 system demonstrate performance propose hdsp scheme 
	 successfully verify analyse propose approach 
	 software simulation statistical measure test voice
