efficient algorithm generalized maximum balanced flow problem 
 minoux 1976 consider maximum balanced flow problem i.e. problem 
	 find maximum flow terminal network n v source 
	 s sink t satisfy constraint arc flow n 
	 bound fix proportion total flow value s t 
	 v vertex set arc set generalization focus 
	 problem maximize total flow value generalized flow 
	 n gain gamma 0 arc flow bound 
	 fix proportion total flow value gamma a)f(a 
	 unit arrive vertex w arc flow f(a identical 
	 upsilon w enter vertex upsilon generalized flow 
	 main result propose polynomial algorithm problem 
	 algorithm run o(mm(n m b log b time b 
	 maximum absolute value integral value use instance 
	 problem m(n m b denote complexity solve 
	 generalize maximum flow problem network n vertex m 
	 arc rational instance express integer 1 b 
	 second algorithm use parameterized technique run 
	 o({m(n m b')}/sup 2/ time
