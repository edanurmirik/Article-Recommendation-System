high resolution high frequency monolithic shoot microinjector free 
	 satellite drop concept design model 
 introduce innovative microinjector design feature bubble valve 
	 entail superior droplet ejection characteristic monolithic 
	 fabrication allow handling wide range liquid new 
	 microinjector use asymmetric bubble reduce crosstalk increase 
	 frequency response eliminate satellite droplet firing 
	 i.e. droplet ejection virtual valve close grow 
	 thermal bubble microchannel isolate microchamber 
	 liquid supply neighboring chamber firing 
	 virtual valve open collapse bubble reduce flow 
	 restriction fast refilling microchamber use bubble 
	 valve bring fast reliable device operation impose 
	 significant complication fabrication physical microvalve 
	 addition special heater configuration 
	 chamber design bubble surround nozzle cut tail 
	 droplet eject completely eliminate satellite droplet 
	 simple dimensional model operation microinjector 
	 use estimate bubble formation liquid refilling
