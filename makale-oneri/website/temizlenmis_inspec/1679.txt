project scheduling time dependent cost branch bind algorithm 
 project network execution activity normal duration 
	 require utilization certain resource fast execution 
	 activity desire additional resource extra cost 
	 require project network cost structure activity 
	 planning horizon project compression problem concern 
	 determination optimal schedule perform activity 
	 satisfy restriction minimize total cost 
	 project execution paper consider project compression problem 
	 time dependent cost structure activity planning 
	 horizon divide regular time interval 
	 cost structure activity vary cost structure 
	 activity remain time interval objective 
	 find optimal project schedule minimize total project cost 
	 present mathematical model problem develop heuristic 
	 exact branch bind algorithm use simulate problem 
	 provide insight computational performance heuristic 
	 branch bind algorithm
