point wavelet application 
 multiresolution analysis mra wavelet provide useful efficient tool 
	 represent function multiple level detail wavelet 
	 representation use broad range application 
	 include image compression physical simulation numerical 
	 analysis paper author construct new class wavelet 
	 point wavelet base interpolatory point 
	 subdivision scheme local support symmetric stable 
	 analysis synthesis algorithm linear time complexity 
	 depend different weight parameter w scaling function 
	 wavelet generate point subdivision scheme 
	 different degree smoothness user select 
	 wavelet relevant practice class wavelet 
	 author apply point wavelet signal compression 
	 result point wavelet behave 
	 b spline wavelet situation
