	 storage 
 relatively simple scheme disk type photopolym high density holographic 
	 storage base angular spatial multiplexing describe 
	 effect optical setup recording capacity density 
	 study calculation analysis scheme 
	 effective scheme base spatioangular multiplexing 
	 disk type photopolym high density holographic storage 
	 limited medium thickness optimal beam recording angle exist 
	 achieve maximum recording capacity density
