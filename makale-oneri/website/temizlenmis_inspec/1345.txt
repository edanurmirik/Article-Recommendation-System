infrared image classification use hidden markov tree 
 image dimensional target generally characterize 
	 visible target subcomponent dictate target sensor 
	 orientation target pose image change quickly variable 
	 pose define class set contiguous target sensor 
	 orientation associated target image relatively 
	 stationary aspect target general characterize 
	 multiple class distinct set wiener filter employ 
	 class image identify presence target subcomponent 
	 karhunen loeve representation use minimize number 
	 filter template associate subcomponent 
	 statistical relationship different target subcomponent 
	 model hidden markov tree hmt hmt classifier 
	 discuss example result present 
	 forward look infrared flir imagery vehicle
