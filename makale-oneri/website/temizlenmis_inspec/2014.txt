adaptive filtering noise reduction hue saturation intensity color space 
 hue saturation intensity hsi color model widely use 
	 color image processing analysis conversion formula 
	 rgb color model hsi nonlinear complicated comparison 
	 conversion formula color model rgb image 
	 degrade random gaussian noise nonlinearity lead 
	 nonuniform noise distribution hsi accurate image analysis 
	 difficult analyze noise characteristic hsi 
	 color model develop adaptive spatial filtering method 
	 reduce magnitude noise nonuniformity noise variance 
	 hsi color space adaptive filtering method filter 
	 kernel pixel dynamically adjust depend value 
	 intensity saturation experiment filter 
	 saturation hue component generate edge map color 
	 gradient find use adaptive filtering method 
	 minimum error rate edge detection improve approximately 15
