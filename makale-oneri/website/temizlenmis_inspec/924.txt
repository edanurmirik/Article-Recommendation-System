dynamic testing inflatable structure use smart material 
 paper present experimental investigation vibration testing 
	 inflated thin film torus use smart material lightweight 
	 inflatable structure attractive satellite application 
	 lightweight flexible highly damp nature inflated 
	 structure pose difficulty ground vibration testing 
	 study polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf patch recently 
	 develop macro fiber composite actuator use sensor 
	 actuator identify modal parameter smart material 
	 integrate unobtrusively skin torus space device 
	 form attractive testing arrangement addition actuator 
	 pvdf sensor torus significantly interfere 
	 suspension mode free free boundary condition 
	 consider integral inflated structure result 
	 indicate potential use smart material measure control 
	 dynamic response inflated structure
