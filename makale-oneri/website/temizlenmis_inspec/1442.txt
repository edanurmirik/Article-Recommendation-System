use construct type c++ union 
 c++ standard state union type member 
	 nontrivial constructor destructor 
	 unreasonable thought clear case 
	 crux problem union build semantic 
	 denote member current member union 
	 compiler know appropriate constructor 
	 destructor union member good reason 
	 want use construct object type union example 
	 want implement scripting language single variable 
	 type integer string list union 
	 perfect candidate implement composite type 
	 restriction construct union member prevent use 
	 exist string list class example stl provide 
	 underlie functionality luckily feature c++ 
	 placement new provide workaround
