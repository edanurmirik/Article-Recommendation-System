wavelet collocation method kind boundary integral equation 
	 acoustic scattering 
 paper consider wavelet algorithm piecewise constant 
	 collocation method apply boundary element solution 
	 kind integral equation arise acoustic scattering conventional 
	 stiffness matrix transform corresponding matrix 
	 respect wavelet basis approximate compress 
	 matrix finally stiffness matrix multiply diagonal 
	 preconditioner result matrix system linear 
	 equation condition sparse use matrix 
	 boundary integral equation solve effectively
