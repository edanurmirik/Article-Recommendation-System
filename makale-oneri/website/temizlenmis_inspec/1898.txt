design stroke dependent damper axle suspension truck 
	 use multibody system dynamic numerical optimization 
 stroke dependent damper design axle suspension truck 
	 damper supply extra damp inward deflection rise 4 
	 cm way damper reduce extreme suspension deflection 
	 deteriorate comfort truck question 
	 stroke dependent damp curve yield good compromise 
	 suspension deflection work space comfort 
	 optimization problem define minimize maximum inward 
	 suspension deflection subject constraint chassis 
	 acceleration typical road undulation optimization 
	 problem solve use sequential linear programming slp 
	 multibody dynamic simulation software optimization run 
	 carry small degree freedom vehicle model 
	 large scale model truck semi trailer combination 
	 result stroke dependent damp reduce large 
	 deflection incidental road disturbance optimum 
	 stroke dependent damp curve relate acceleration bind 
	 mean vehicle model simulation numerical optimization 
	 able quantify trade suspension deflection 
	 work space truck comfort
