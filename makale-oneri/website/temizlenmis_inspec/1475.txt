 present study investigate effect discomfort glare drive 
	 behavior participant old young europeans expose 
	 simulated low- beam light source mount hood 
	 instrument vehicle participant drive night actual traffic 
	 track consist urban rural highway stretch 
	 result relatively low glare source cause significant 
	 drop detect simulated pedestrian roadside 
	 participant drive significantly slow dark winding road 
	 old participant large drop pedestrian detection 
	 performance reduce driving speed result

	 scale discomfort glare practically useless predictor 
	 drive performance furthermore maximum headlamp intensity 
	 1380 cd headlamp appear acceptable upper limit
