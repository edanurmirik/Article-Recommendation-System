numerical study 2d free surface wave fix 
 motion surface wave effect interesting 
	 challenging phenomenon nature use boundary integral 
	 method compute analyze problem linear analysis 
	 linearize equation bound error increase compatible 
	 condition contribute cancellation instable 
	 kelvin helmholtz term effect existence 
	 equation hard determine limitation prove 
	 true limitation swing interface 
	 small distance surface 
	 large order maintain stability computation 
	 compatible relationship satisfied numerical example 
	 simulation stand wave break wave calculate 
	 case shallow find behavior wave 
	 singular
