detection estimation abrupt change variability process 
 detection change point normal mean study problem 
	 parallel problem detect change variance 
	 attention form generalize likelihood ratio test statistic 
	 long know null distribution resist exact analysis 
	 paper formulate change point problem sequence 
	 chi square random variable describe procedure exact 
	 distribution likelihood ratio statistic degree 
	 freedom upper low bound odd 
	 non integer degree freedom liberal conservative 
	 bound chi /sub 1//sup 2/ degree freedom 
	 simulation reasonably tight important problem testing 
	 change normal variance individual observation correspond 
	 chi /sub 1//sup 2/ case non null case cover 
	 confidence interval true change point derive 
	 methodology illustrate application quality control 
	 deep level gold application include ambulatory monitoring 
	 medical datum econometric
