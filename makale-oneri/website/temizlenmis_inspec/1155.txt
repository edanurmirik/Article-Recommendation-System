leaf sequence algorithm enlarge treatment field length imrt 
 mlc base imrt maximum usable field size small 
	 maximum field size conventional treatment 
	 constraint overtravel distance mlc leave and/or jaw 
	 use new leaf sequence algorithm usable imrt field length 
	 perpendicular mlc motion equal 
	 length mlc field violate upper jaw overtravel 
	 limit intensity pattern criterion propose 
	 assess intensity pattern deliver violation 
	 jaw position constraint criterion meet new 
	 algorithm consider jaw position constraint 
	 segmentation step shoot delivery method strategy 
	 employ algorithm connect intensity element outside 
	 jaw overtravel limit inside jaw overtravel limit 
	 method use establish connection 
	 segmentation modify previously publish algorithm areal 
	 algorithm include change intensity level alternate 
	 leaf sequence direction limit segment field size 
	 algorithm test 1000 random intensity pattern 
	 dimension 21 27 cm sup 2/ 800 intensity pattern high 
	 intensity outside jaw overtravel limit different type 
	 clinical treatment plan undeliverable use 
	 segmentation method commercial treatment planning system 
	 new algorithm achieve success rate 100 test pattern 
	 1000 random pattern new algorithm yield similar 
	 average number segment 36.9+or-2.9 comparison 36.6+or-1.3 
	 use areal algorithm 800 pattern high 
	 intensity outside jaw overtravel limit new algorithm 
	 result increase 25 average number segment 
	 compare areal algorithm areal algorithm fail 
	 create deliverable segment 90 pattern use single 
	 isocenter new algorithm provide solution extend usable 
	 imrt field length 21 27 cm imrt commercial linear 
	 accelerator use step shoot delivery method
