degree freedom precision motion stage 
 article present design performance evaluation 
	 degree freedom piezoelectrically actuate fine motion stage 
	 use dimensional error compensation long range 
	 translation mechanism development single element piezoelectric 
	 linear displacement actuator capable translation 1.67 mu m 
	 900 v potential electrode 27.4 n axial load 
	 0.5 mm lateral distortion present finite element method 
	 develop use evaluate resonant frequency stage 
	 platform complete assembly platform payload 
	 general error approximately 10.0 finite element 
	 result experimentally measure value observe 
	 complete fine motion stage provide approximately or-0.93 mu m 
	 translation or-38.0 mu rad rotation plane 
	 motion use excitation range 1000 v. impulse response
