collocation formulation multistep method variable step size 
	 extension 
 multistep method classically construct specially design difference 
	 operator equidistant time grid practically useful 
	 implement vary step size accord 
	 error control algorithm known extend adams bdf 
	 formula variable step size formulation paper present 
	 collocation approach construct variable step size formula 
	 use piecewise polynomial k step method 
	 order k+1 variable step size polynomial collocation formulation
