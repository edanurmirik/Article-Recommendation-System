analytic center cut plane method semidefinite feasibility problem 
 semidefinite feasibility problem arise area operation research 
	 abstract form problem describe find point 
	 nonempty bound convex body gamma cone symmetric 
	 positive semidefinite matrix assume gamma define 
	 oracle m m symmetric positive semidefinite 
	 matrix gamma confirm y epsilon gamma return cut 
	 i.e. symmetric matrix gamma half space y 
	 y or= y study analytic center cut plane algorithm 
	 problem iteration algorithm compute 
	 approximate analytic center working set define cutting 
	 plane system generate previous iteration approximate 
	 analytic center solution algorithm terminate 
	 new cut plane return oracle add system 
	 number iteration increase working set shrink 
	 algorithm eventually find solution problem iterate 
	 generate algorithm positive definite matrix 
	 algorithm bad case complexity o*(m sup 3// epsilon /sup 2/ 
	 total number cut use epsilon maximum 
	 radius ball contain gamma
