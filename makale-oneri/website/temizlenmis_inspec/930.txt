narx base technique modelling magneto rheological damp device 
 paper present methodology identify variable structure nonlinear 
	 model magneto rheological damper mrd similar device 
	 peculiarity respect mainstream literature 
	 especially conceive obtain model structurally simple 
	 easy estimate suited model base control goal 
	 pursue adopt linear parameter narx model 
	 identification method develop base minimization 
	 simulation error method capable select model 
	 structure parameter require 
	 priori structural information set validation test report 
	 aim demonstrate technique efficiency compare 
	 widely accept mrd modelling approach
