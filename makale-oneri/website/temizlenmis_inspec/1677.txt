 recently algebraic integer programming ip solver propose 
	 base theory grobner basis main difficulty 
	 solver size grobner basis generate algorithm 
	 propose far large grobner basis generate 
	 introduce additional variable consider generic ip 
	 problem ip sub c/. improvement propose 
	 hosten sturmfels method grin design avoid additional 
	 variable thomas truncate grobner basis method compute 
	 reduce grobner basis specific ip problem ip sub c/(b 
	 generalisation ipa c paper propose new 
	 algebraic algorithm solve ip problem new algorithm 
	 minimised geometric buchberger algorithm combine hosten 
	 sturmfels grin thomas truncate grobner basis method compute 
	 fundamental segment ip problem ip sub c/ directly 
	 original space truncated grobner basis specific ip 
	 problem ip sub c/ b carry experiment compare 
	 algorithm geometric buchberger algorithm 
	 truncated geometric buchberger algorithm algorithm grin 
	 experiment new algorithm offer significant 
	 performance improvement
