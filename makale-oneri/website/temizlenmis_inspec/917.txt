efficient transitive closure reasoning combine class containment 
	 hierarchy 
 class hierarchy form backbone implement knowledge 
	 representation reasoning system use inheritance 
	 classification transitive closure reasoning hierarchy 
	 important artificial intelligence hierarchy e.g. 
	 containment hierarchy receive attention artificial 
	 intelligence paper present architecture implementation 
	 hierarchy reasoner integrate class hierarchy 
	 hierarchy containment hierarchy structure order 
	 implement reasoner useful need operate 
	 speed comparable human reasoning real world hierarchy 
	 large special technique need use achieve 
	 develop set parallel algorithm datum representation 
	 maximally reduce tree cover purpose maximally 
	 reduce tree cover improvement materialize transitive 
	 closure representation appear literature 
	 experiment medical vocabulary transitive closure 
	 reason combine class containment hierarchy near 
	 constant time possible fix hardware configuration
