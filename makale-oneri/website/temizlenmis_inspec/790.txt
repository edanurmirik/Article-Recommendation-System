datum assimilation local model error forecast deterministic model 
 popular datum assimilation technique use today 
	 kalman filter type provide improved estimate state 
	 system current time level base actual measurement 
	 forecasting viewpoint correspond updating 
	 initial condition standard forecasting procedure run 
	 model uncorrecte future drive predict boundary 
	 force condition problem methodology 
	 update initial condition quickly wash certain 
	 forecast horizon model prediction 
	 initially uncorrecte model study demonstrate 
	 assimilation error forecast present case use 
	 local model entire model domain correct 
	 extend forecast horizon i.e. long update initial condition 
	 wash demonstrate significant improvement 
	 conventional methodology alternate use local model 
	 explore distribution error forecast 
	 entire model domain compare conventional 
	 kalman filter type scheme
