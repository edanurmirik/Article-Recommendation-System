	 issue implement checkpointing recovery scheme fault tolerant 
	 distribute system paper present new scheme allow 
	 process select proper checkpointing interval dynamically 
	 process system evaluate cost checkpointing possible 
	 rollback checkpointing interval select proper time 
	 interval checkpointing unlike scheme 
	 overhead incur checkpointing rollback activity 
	 consider cost evaluation current communication 
	 pattern reflect selection checkpointing interval 
	 propose scheme require extra message communication 
	 checkpointe interval selection easily incorporate 
	 exist checkpointing coordination scheme
