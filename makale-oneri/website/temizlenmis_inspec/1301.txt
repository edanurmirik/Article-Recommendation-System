integrate fire neuron drive correlate stochastic input 
 neuron sensitive correlation synaptic input 
	 analytical model explicitly include correlation hard 
	 solve analytically influence neuron response 
	 difficult ascertain gain intuition problem 
	 study firing time simple integrate fire model neuron 
	 drive correlate binary variable represent total input 
	 current analytic expression obtain average firing rate 
	 coefficient variation measure spike train variability 
	 function mean variance correlation time stochastic 
	 input result computer simulation excellent agreement 
	 expression model increase correlation 
	 time general produce increase average firing rate 
	 variability output spike train magnitude 
	 change depend differentially relative value 
	 input mean variance increase firing rate high 
	 variance large relative mean increase 
	 variability high variance relatively small 
	 addition firing rate tend finite limit value 
	 correlation time increase infinity coefficient 
	 variation typically diverge result suggest temporal 
	 correlation play major role determine variability 
	 intensity neuronal spike train
