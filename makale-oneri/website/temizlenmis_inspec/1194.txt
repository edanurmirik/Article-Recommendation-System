new method oscillatory problem base classical code 
 numerical integration differential equation oscillatory solution 
	 common problem field apply science 
	 method specially devise kind problem 
	 calculation coefficient need computational 
	 effort classical code coefficient depend 
	 step size simple manner contrary work 
	 present new algorithm specially design perturb oscillator 
	 coefficient simple dependence step size 
	 method obtain competitive compare classical 
	 special code
