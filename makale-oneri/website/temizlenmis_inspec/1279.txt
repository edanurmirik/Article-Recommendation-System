place transition petri net evolution recording way analysis synthesis 
 semantic domain place transition petri net relationship 
	 consider monoid respectively fire sequence 
	 process trace dependence graph analysis 
	 synthesis problem state solve monoid process 
	 define non standard way net consideration involve weight 
	 arrow capacity finite infinite place 
	 analysis synthesis task require net pure i.e. 
	 transition pre set post set disjoint
