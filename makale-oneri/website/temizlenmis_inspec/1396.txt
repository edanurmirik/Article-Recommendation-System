construction double sample s control chart agile manufacturing 
 double sampling ds x control chart design allow quick detection 
	 small shift process mean provide quick response agile 
	 manufacturing environment ds x control chart assume 
	 process standard deviation remain unchanged entire 
	 course statistical process control complementary 
	 ds chart use monitor process variation cause 
	 change process standard deviation develop 
	 paper development ds s chart quickly detect small 
	 shift process standard deviation agile manufacturing 
	 present construction ds s chart base 
	 concept construct ds x chart formulate 
	 optimization problem solve genetic algorithm 
	 efficiency ds s control chart compare 
	 traditional s control chart result ds s control 
	 chart economically preferable alternative detect
