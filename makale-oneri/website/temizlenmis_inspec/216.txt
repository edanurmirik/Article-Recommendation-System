	 t matrix method nonlinear fitting technique 
 new computer program develop base t matrix method generate 
	 large number total extinction cross section tcs value 
	 realistic raindrop deform balance force 
	 act drop fail gravity describe shape 
	 pruppacher pitter 1971 datum dimension 
	 raindrop mean effective radius 0 3.25 mm frequency 
	 10 80 ghz horizontal vertical polarization 
	 temperature 0 10 20 degree c store establish data 
	 bank furthermore curve fit technique i.e. interpolation 
	 order 3 implement tcs value data bank 
	 interpolate tcs result obtain readily 
	 interpolation process negligible null computational time 
	 effort error analysis carry high accuracy 
	 present analysis applicability interpolation 
	 operating frequency 15 21.225 38 ghz locally use 
	 singapore new tcs value obtain new fast 
	 efficient interpolation good accuracy
