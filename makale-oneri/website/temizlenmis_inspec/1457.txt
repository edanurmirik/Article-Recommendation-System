discontinuous galerkin method transient analysis wave propagation 
	 unbounded domain 
 technique base discontinuous galerkin finite element method 
	 develop apply derivation absorb boundary 
	 condition analysis transient wave propagation condition 
	 exact discretization error involve furthermore 
	 computational cost associate use condition order 
	 magnitude low condition base green function 
	 time step scheme result implicit method conjunction 
	 boundary condition appear unconditionally stable
