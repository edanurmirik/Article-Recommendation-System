topology reduce surface simplification use discrete solid representation 
 paper present new approach generate coarse level approximation 
	 topologically complex model dramatic topology reduction 
	 achieve convert 3d model volumetric 
	 representation approach produce valid error bound model 
	 support creation approximation interpenetrate 
	 original model completely contain input solid 
	 bound simple implement version approach 
	 present discuss method perform 
	 significantly surface base approach 
	 simplify topologically rich model scene complex 
	 mechanical assembly
