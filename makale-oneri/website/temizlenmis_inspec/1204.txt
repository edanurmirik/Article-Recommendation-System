design prototype performance tool interface openmp 
 paper propose performance tool interface openmp similar spirit 
	 mpi profiling interface intent define clear 
	 portable api openmp execution event visible runtime 
	 performance tool present design use source level 
	 instrumentation approach base openmp directive rewrite rule 
	 instrument directive combination apply generate 
	 interface consistent directive semantic pass 
	 context information e.g. source code location portable 
	 efficient way propose openmp performance api far allow user 
	 function arbitrary code region mark performance 
	 measurement control use new openmp directive prototype 
	 propose openmp performance interface develop compatible 
	 performance library expert automatic event trace analyzer 
	 17 18 tau performance analysis framework 13 directive 
	 instrumentation transformation define implement 
	 source source translation tool opari application example 
	 present expert tau openmp performance 
	 interface opari instrumentation tool operation use 
	 mpi profiling interface example 
	 demonstrate propose approach provide portable robust 
	 solution performance analysis openmp mixed mode openmp 
	 mpi application
