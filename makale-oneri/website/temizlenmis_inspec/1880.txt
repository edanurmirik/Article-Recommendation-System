simulation transient testing numerical relay 
 hybrid practical solution relay evaluation present main 
	 issue account power system simulation relay 
	 simulation consist different stage system 
	 simulation carry mean emtp complement 
	 additional feature filter location determination 
	 fault parameter allow compare simulated actual fault 
	 record improve guarantee correct system simulation relay 
	 simulation include filter algorithm relaying unit 
	 decision logic play simulated real fault actual 
	 relay compare simulated real response check correct 
	 relay simulation
