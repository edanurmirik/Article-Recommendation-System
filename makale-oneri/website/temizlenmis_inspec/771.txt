pareto optimal formulation cost versus colorimetric accuracy trade 
	 printer color management 
 color management printing digital image challenging task 
	 primarily nonlinear ink mix behavior presence 
	 redundant solution print device ink 
	 algorithms conversion image datum printer specific format 
	 typically design achieve single predetermine rendering 
	 intent colorimetric accuracy present cielab cmyk 
	 color conversion scheme base general pareto optimal formulation 
	 printer color management scheme operate use 149 color 
	 characterization datum set select efficiently capture entire 
	 cmyk gamut scheme use artificial neural network 
	 transfer function cielab cmyk space second 
	 scheme base reformulation tetrahedral interpolation 
	 optimization problem characterization datum divide tetrahedra 
	 interpolation base approach use program qhull 
	 remove common restriction characterization datum 
	 organize scheme offer user control trade problem 
	 cost versus reproduction accuracy allow user specify print 
	 objective use constraint maximum allowable ink 
	 maximum allowable ae*/sub ab/. formulation minimization ink 
	 particularly favorable integrate clipping 
	 gamut compression feature single methodology
