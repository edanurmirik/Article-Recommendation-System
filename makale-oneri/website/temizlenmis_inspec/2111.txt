extended depth focus imaging chlorophyll fluorescence intact leave 
 image dynamic change chlorophyll fluorescence provide valuable mean 
	 examine localise change photosynthetic function 
	 microscope base system provide excellent spatial resolution 
	 allow response individual cell measure 
	 system restricted depth focus leave inherently 
	 uneven small proportion image focal plane 
	 focus report describe development algorithm 
	 specifically adapt image chlorophyll fluorescence 
	 photosynthetic function live plant cell allow 
	 extended focus image reconstruct image 
	 different focal plane describe procedure use 
	 reconstruct image chlorophyll fluorescence calculate 
	 photosynthetic parameter produce map leaf topology 
	 robustness procedure demonstrate use leave 
	 number different plant specie
