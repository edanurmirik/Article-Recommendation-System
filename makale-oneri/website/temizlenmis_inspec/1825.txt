fuzzy logic control shunt active power filter power quality improvement 
 simulation experimental study fuzzy logic control phase 
	 shunt active power filter improve power quality compensate 
	 harmonic reactive power require nonlinear load present 
	 advantage fuzzy control base linguistic 
	 description require mathematical model system 
	 fuzzy control scheme realise inexpensive dedicate 
	 micro controller intel 8031 base system compensation process 
	 base sense line current approach different 
	 conventional method require harmonic reactive volt ampere 
	 requirement load performance fuzzy logic controller 
	 compare conventional pi controller dynamic behavior 
	 fuzzy controller find conventional pi 
	 controller pwm pattern generation base carrierless hysteresis 
	 base current control obtain switch signal 
	 simulation experimental result present steady state 
	 transient condition
