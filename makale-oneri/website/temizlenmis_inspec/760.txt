improved fuzzy mcdm model base ideal anti ideal concept 
 liang present 1999 fuzzy multiple criterion decision making mcdm method 
	 base concept ideal anti ideal point despite 
	 merit liang method follow limitation objective 
	 criterion convert dimensionless index subjective 
	 criterion convert prevent compatibility 
	 criterion ii formula convert objective criterion 
	 reliable iii unreliable ranking method i.e. maximize set 
	 minimize set apply rank fuzzy number paper 
	 apply hsu chen method suggest fuzzy number rank 
	 method propose improved fuzzy mcdm model base ideal 
	 anti ideal concept overcome shortcoming liang method 
	 numerical example demonstrate effectiveness feasibility 
	 propose rank method improved model respectively
