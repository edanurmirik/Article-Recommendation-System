	 detection approach alternate digital tree adt algorithm 
	 particular efficient algorithm term augmented spatial 
	 digital tree asdt algorithm propose present work 
	 asdt algorithm adopt different point representation scheme use 
	 low comer vertex represent hyper-)rectangle 
	 upper comer vertex serve augment information consequently 
	 asdt algorithm work space original 
	 n dimensional space general balanced tree 
	 expect introduction additional 
	 bounding subregion rectangle associate tree node 
	 possible significantly reduce number node visit 
	 region search node visit slightly 
	 expensive example arise computational mechanic 
	 present provide assessment performance asdt 
	 numerical result indicate asdt 3.9 time
