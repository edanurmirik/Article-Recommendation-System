scalable secure group communication ip multicast 
 introduce analyze scalable rekeying scheme implement secure 
	 group communication internet protocol multicast 
	 scheme incur constant processing message storage overhead 
	 rekey operation single member join leave group 
	 logarithmic overhead bulk simultaneous change group 
	 membership bound hold group dynamic know 
	 priori rekeying algorithm require particular clustering 
	 member secure multicast group describe protocol 
	 achieve clustering feasible efficiently 
	 cluster member realistic internet like topology evaluate 
	 overhead rekeying scheme previously 
	 publish scheme simulation internet topology map 
	 contain 280 000 router analysis detailed 
	 simulation rekeying scheme perform 
	 previous scheme single change group membership far 
	 bulk group change algorithm outperform previously know 
	 scheme order magnitude term actual bandwidth 
	 usage processing cost storage requirement
