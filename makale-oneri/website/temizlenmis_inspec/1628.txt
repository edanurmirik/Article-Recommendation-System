quasi newton algorithm adaptive minor component extraction 
 adaptive quasi newton algorithm develop extract single minor 
	 component correspond small eigenvalue stationary 
	 sample covariance matrix deflation technique instead commonly 
	 use inflation method apply extract high order minor 
	 component algorithm enjoy advantage simple 
	 computational complexity highly modular parallel structure 
	 efficient implementation simulation result 
	 demonstrate effectiveness propose algorithm extract 
	 multiple minor component adaptively
