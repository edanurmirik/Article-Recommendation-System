multiple shooting use dichotomically stable integrator solve 
	 differential algebraic equation 
 previous work author establish 
	 dichotomically stable discretization need solve stiff 
	 boundary value problem ordinary differential equation ode 
	 sharp boundary layer occur end interval 
	 dichotomically stable implicit runge kutta method use 3 stage 
	 fourth order lobatto iiia formulae implement variable 
	 step size initial value integrator use 
	 multiple shooting approach case index 
	 differential algebraic equation daes use lobatto iiia 
	 formulae advantage comparable gaussian method 
	 order differential algebraic variable 
	 need treat separately ode integrator 
	 adapt solution index dae result 
	 integrator symdae insert multiple shoot code 
	 mshdae previously develop r. lamour differential algebraic 
	 boundary value problem standard version mshdae use bdf 
	 integrator dichotomically stable stiff test 
	 problem fail integrate interval interest 
	 dichotomically stable integrator symdae encounter difficulty 
	 problem modify version mshdae produce 
	 accurate solution limit impose computer word length 
	 efficiency solution process improve increase 
	 stiffness nonstiff problem solution entirely 
	 satisfactory
