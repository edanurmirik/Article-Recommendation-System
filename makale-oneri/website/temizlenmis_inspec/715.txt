quadratic 0 1 knapsack problem series parallel support 
 consider special case quadratic 0 1 knapsack problem qkp 
	 underlie graph structure fairly simple 
	 variant edge series parallel graph dynamic programming 
	 algorithm pseudo polynomial time complexity fully 
	 polynomial time approximation scheme strong contrast 
	 variant vertex series parallel graph strongly 
	 np complete
