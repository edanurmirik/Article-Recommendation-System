adaptive wavelet method ii elliptic case 
 paper concern design analysis adaptive wavelet 
	 method system operator equation main accomplishment 
	 extend range applicability adaptive wavelet base 
	 method develop previously symmetric positive definite problem 
	 indefinite unsymmetric system operator equation 
	 accomplish introduce technique square 
	 formulation develop previously transform original 
	 continuous problem equivalent infinite system equation 
	 pose euclidean metric 
	 utilize adaptive technique solve result infinite system 
	 equation wide range problem new 
	 adaptive method perform asymptotically optimal complexity i.e. 
	 recover approximate solution desire accuracy 
	 computational expense stay proportional number term 
	 corresponding wavelet good n term approximation important 
	 advantage adaptive approach automatically stabilize 
	 numerical procedure instance compatibility 
	 constraint choice trial space like lbb condition 
	 long arise
