speaker adaptive modeling vocal tract normalization 
 paper present method speaker adaptive modeling use vocal tract 
	 normalization vtn experimental test database 
	 propose new training method vtn use single density 
	 acoustic model hmm state select scale factor 
	 frequency axis avoid problem mixture density tend 
	 learn scale factor training speaker 
	 use select scale factor use single gaussian 
	 density select scale factor training result low 
	 error rate use mixture density recognition phase 
	 propose improvement know pass strategy use 
	 non normalize acoustic model recognition pass instead 
	 normalize model low error rate obtain recognition 
	 test method compare fast variant vtn pass 
	 strategy efficient method suboptimal scale 
	 factor word sequence determine sequentially find 
	 telephone digit string recognition suboptimality reduce 
	 vtn gain recognition performance 30 relative summary 
	 german spontaneous speech task verbmobil wsj task german 
	 telephone digit string corpus sietill propose method vtn 
	 reduce error rate significantly
