genetic algorithm guide selection variable selection subset selection 
 novel genetic algorithm guide selection method gas describe 
	 method utilize simple encoding scheme represent 
	 compound variable use construct qsar qspr model genetic 
	 algorithm utilize simultaneously optimize encode 
	 variable include descriptor compound subset gas 
	 method generate multiple model apply subset 
	 compound typically subset represent cluster different 
	 chemotype procedure base molecular similarity present 
	 determine model apply test set 
	 compound variable selection method implement gas 
	 test compare use selwood datum set n 31 compound nu 
	 53 descriptor result method comparable 
	 publish method subset selection method implement gas 
	 test use artificial datum set n 100 point nu 
	 1 descriptor examine ability subset data point second 
	 apply analyze xlogp datum set n 1831 compound nu 126 
	 descriptor method able correctly identify artificial datum 
	 point belong subset analysis xlogp data set 
	 subset selection method useful improve 
	 qsar qspr model variable selection method fail
