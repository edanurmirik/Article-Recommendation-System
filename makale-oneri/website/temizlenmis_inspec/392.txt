time vary property renal autoregulatory mechanism 
 order assess possible time vary property renal 
	 autoregulation time frequency time scale method apply 
	 renal blood flow broad band force arterial blood pressure 
	 fluctuation single nephron renal blood flow spontaneous 
	 oscillation obtain normotensive sprague dawley wistar 
	 long evans rat spontaneously hypertensive rat time frequency 
	 analysis normotensive hypertensive blood flow datum obtain 
	 kidney single nephron 
	 myogenic tubuloglomerular feedback tgf mechanism 
	 time vary characteristic furthermore utilize renyi 
	 entropy measure complexity blood flow dynamic 
	 time frequency plane effort discern difference 
	 normotensive hypertensive recording find clear difference 
	 renyi entropy normotensive hypertensive blood flow 
	 recording kidney level force p 0.037 
	 spontaneous arterial pressure fluctuation p 0.033 
	 single nephron level p 0.008 especially single nephron 
	 level mean renyi entropy significantly large hypertensive 
	 normotensive rat suggest complex dynamic 
	 hypertensive condition far evaluate 
	 separation dynamic normotensive hypertensive rat 
	 find prescribed frequency range myogenic tgf 
	 mechanism employ multiresolution wavelet transform analysis 
	 reveal exclusively scale range correspond 
	 frequency interval myogenic tgf mechanism width 
	 blood flow wavelet coefficient fall disjoint set 
	 normotensive hypertensive rat separation scale 
	 myogenic tgf frequency range distinct obtain 100 
	 accuracy observation remain valid 
	 kidney blood pressure flow datum result suggest understanding 
	 time vary property mechanism require 
	 complete description renal autoregulation
