improved approximation max cut graph bound degree 
 let alpha approximately=0.87856 denote good approximation ratio currently 
	 know max cut problem general graph consider 
	 semidefinite relaxation max cut problem round use 
	 random hyperplane rounding technique m.x. goemans d.p. 
	 williamson 1995 add local improvement step 
	 graph degree delta algorithm achieve 
	 approximation ratio alpha epsilon epsilon 0 
	 constant depend delta .. use computer assist 
	 analysis graph maximal degree 3 algorithm 
	 obtain approximation ratio 0.921 3 regular 
	 graph approximation ratio 0.924 note 
	 semidefinite relaxation max cut use goemans williamson 
	 integrality gap 1/0.885 2 regular graph
