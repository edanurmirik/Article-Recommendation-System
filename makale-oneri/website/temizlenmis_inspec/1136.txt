q learning risk sensitive control 
 propose risk sensitive control finite markov chain counterpart 
	 popular q learn algorithm classical markov decision 
	 process algorithm converge probability 
	 desire solution proof technique adaptation 
	 o.d.e approach analysis stochastic approximation 
	 algorithm work involve use analysis 
	 specific o.d.e.s arise
