vibration control structure use tune mass damper development 
	 system suppress displacement auxiliary mass 
 vibration control structure use active tune mass damper 
	 atmd stroke auxiliary mass limited difficult 
	 control vibration case large disturbance input 
	 paper method propose problem 
	 method switch control system type controller 
	 controller normal controller small relative 
	 displacement auxiliary mass effective 
	 mode vibration large relative displacement 
	 auxiliary mass new variable gain control system construct 
	 switch controller method brake system 
	 active vibration control necessary use actuator active 
	 control use actuator propose system brake 
	 suppress displacement increase auxiliary mass large 
	 disturbance input finally system design 
	 effectiveness system confirm simulation
