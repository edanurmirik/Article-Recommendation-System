	 approach 
 introduce dual differential game repeat game lack 
	 information natural continuous time version 
	 dual game introduce de meyer 1996 traditional way study 
	 value differential game discrete time approximation 
	 follow opposite approach identify limit value 
	 repeat game discrete time value differential game 
	 use recursive structure finitely repeat 
	 version dual game construct differential game 
	 upper value uniform discretization satisfy precisely 
	 property value dual differential game exist 
	 unique viscosity solution order derivative equation 
	 limit condition identify solution translate viscosity 
	 property primal
