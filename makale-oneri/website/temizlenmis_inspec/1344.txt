restoration archival document use wavelet technique 
 paper address problem restore handwritten archival document 
	 recover content interfere handwriting 
	 reverse cause seeping ink present novel method 
	 work match document 
	 interfere stroke map correspond stroke 
	 originate reverse facilitate identification 
	 foreground interfere stroke wavelet reconstruction 
	 process iteratively enhance foreground stroke smear 
	 interfere stroke strengthen discriminating capability 
	 improved canny edge detector interfere stroke 
	 method restore document effectively average 
	 precision recall rate foreground text extraction 84 percent 
	 96 percent respectively
