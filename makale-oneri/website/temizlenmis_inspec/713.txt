efficient feasibility testing dial ride problem 
 dial ride system involve dispatch vehicle satisfy demand set 
	 customer vehicle operate agency request 
	 item tie pick specific location deliver specific 
	 destination dial ride problem differ routing 
	 scheduling problem typically involve service relate 
	 constraint common maximum wait time constraint 
	 maximum ride time constraint presence maximum wait time 
	 maximum ride time restriction clear efficiently 
	 determine sequence pickup delivery 
	 feasible schedule exist demonstrate fact 
	 linear time
