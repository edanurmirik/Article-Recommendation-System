feedforward maximum power point tracking pv system use fuzzy controller 
 feedforward maximum power mp point track scheme develop 
	 interleaved dual boost idb converter feed photovoltaic pv system 
	 use fuzzy controller tracking algorithm change duty ratio 
	 converter solar cell array sca voltage equal 
	 voltage correspond mp point solar insolation 
	 feedforward loop generate error signal 
	 compare instantaneous array voltage reference voltage 
	 reference voltage feedforward loop correspond mp 
	 point obtain line train neural network experimental 
	 datum use line training neural network employ 
	 propagation algorithm propose fuzzy feedforward peak power 
	 tracking effectiveness demonstrate simulation 
	 experimental result compare conventional proportional 
	 plus integral pi controller base system finally comparative 
	 study interleaved boost conventional boost converter pv 
	 application suitability discuss
