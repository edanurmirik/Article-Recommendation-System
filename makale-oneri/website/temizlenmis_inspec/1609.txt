model undesirable factor efficiency evaluation 
 data envelopment analysis dea measure relative efficiency decision 
	 unit dmus multiple performance factor group 
	 output input efficient frontier determine 
	 inefficient dmu improve performance reach efficient 
	 frontier increase current output level decrease 
	 current input level desirable good 
	 undesirable bad factor present example inefficiency 
	 exist production process final product manufacture 
	 production waste pollutant output waste 
	 pollutant undesirable reduce improve 
	 performance use classification invariance property 
	 standard dea model use improve performance 
	 increase desirable output decrease undesirable 
	 output method apply situation input 
	 need increase improve performance linearity 
	 convexity dea preserve proposal
