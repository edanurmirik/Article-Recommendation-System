plenoptic image edit 
 paper present new class interactive image edit operation 
	 design maintain consistency multiple image physical 
	 3d scene distinguish feature operation edit 
	 image propagate automatically image 
	 unknown 3d scene modify modified scene 
	 view interactively camera viewpoint 
	 different scene illumination approach useful 
	 power assist enable user quickly modify image 
	 edit second means construct editing 
	 image base scene representation manipulate set photograph 
	 approach work extend operation like image painting 
	 scissoring morph alter scene plenoptic 
	 function physically consistent way affect scene 
	 appearance viewpoint simultaneously key element 
	 realize operation new volumetric decomposition technique 
	 reconstruct scene plenoptic function incomplete set 
	 camera viewpoint
