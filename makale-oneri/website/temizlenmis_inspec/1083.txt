differential algebraic system anew 
 propose figure lead term differential algebraic system 
	 precisely low index linear system properly state 
	 lead term consider detail particular ask 
	 numerical integration method apply original system 
	 reach inherent regular ode conservation i.e. 
	 discretization decouple commute sense general 
	 expect commutativity additional difficulty 
	 like strong stepsize restriction arise abstract 
	 differential algebraic equation infinite dimensional hilbert space 
	 introduce index notion generalize equation 
	 particular partial differential algebraic equation consider 
	 abstract formulation
