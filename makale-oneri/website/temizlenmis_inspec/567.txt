hidden markov model base tool wear monitoring turn 
 paper present new modeling framework tool wear monitoring 
	 machining process use hidden markov model hmm feature vector 
	 extract vibration signal measure turning 
	 codebook design use vector quantization convert 
	 feature vector symbol sequence hidden markov model 
	 series experiment conduct evaluate effectiveness 
	 approach different length training datum observation 
	 sequence experimental result successful tool state 
	 detection rate high 97 achieve use approach
