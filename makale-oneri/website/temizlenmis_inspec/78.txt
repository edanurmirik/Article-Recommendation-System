apply genetic algorithm solve fuzzy optimal profit problem 
 study investigate application genetic algorithm solve 
	 fuzzy optimization problem arise business economic 
	 problem fuzzy price determine use linear quadratic 
	 fuzzy demand function linear cost function objective 
	 find optimal fuzzy profit derive fuzzy 
	 price fuzzy cost traditional method solve problem 
	 1 extension principle 2 use interval arithmetic 
	 alpha -cut argue traditional method solve 
	 problem restrictive produce optimal solution 
	 alternative approach possibly need use genetic 
	 algorithm obtain approximate solution fuzzy optimal 
	 profit problem use membership function 
	 empirical example effectiveness approach 
	 theoretical proof validate correctness algorithm 
	 conclude genetic algorithm produce good approximate solution 
	 apply solve fuzzy optimization problem
