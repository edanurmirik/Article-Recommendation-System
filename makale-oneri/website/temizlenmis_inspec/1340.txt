orthogonal decomposition complete digraph 
 family g isomorphic copy digraph g 
	 orthogonal decomposition complete digraph d sub n/ g 
	 arc d sub n/ belong exactly member g union 
	 different element g contain precisely pair 
	 reverse arc digraph h h family mh vertex disjoint 
	 union m copy h paper consider orthogonal 
	 decomposition h family objective prove existence 
	 orthogonal decomposition certain necessary 
	 condition hold m sufficiently large
