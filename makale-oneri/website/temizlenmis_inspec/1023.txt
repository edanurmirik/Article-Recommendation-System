simple nonlinear dual window operator edge detection 
 propose nonlinear edge detection technique base 
	 concentric circular window operator perform preliminary 
	 selection edge candidate use standard gradient use 
	 dual window operator reveal edge zero cross point 
	 simple difference function depend minimum maximum 
	 value window comparison establish 
	 technique report term visual appearance computational 
	 efficiency detect edge surely comparable 
	 canny laplacian gaussian algorithm noteworthy 
	 reduction term computational load
