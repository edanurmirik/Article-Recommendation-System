control transient thermal response sequential open die forge 
	 trajectory optimization approach 
 trajectory optimization approach apply design sequence 
	 open die forge operation order control transient thermal 
	 response large titanium alloy billet time 
	 billet soak furnace prior successive forge operation 
	 optimize minimize total process time simultaneously 
	 satisfy constraint maximum minimum value billet 
	 temperature distribution avoid microstructural defect 
	 forge result indicate differential heating profile 
	 effective meet design goal
