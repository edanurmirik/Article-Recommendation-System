multiple model adaptive estimation filter spawning 
 multiple model adaptive estimation mmae filter spawning use 
	 detect estimate partial actuator failure vista f-16 
	 truth model degree freedom simulation provide 
	 calspan general dynamics design model choose 13 state 
	 linearize model include order actuator model actuator 
	 failure incorporate truth model design model 
	 assume failure free stream filter spawning use include 
	 additional filter partial actuator failure hypothesis 
	 mmae bank spawned filter base vary degree partial 
	 failure term effectiveness associate 
	 complete actuaton failure hypothesis high conditional 
	 probability correctness current time blend 
	 estimate failure effectiveness find use filter 
	 estimate base failure hypothesis complete actuator 
	 failure hypothesis spawned filter partial failure 
	 hypothesis yield substantial precision effectiveness 
	 estimation compare possible spawn additional 
	 filter partial failure adaptation viable methodology
