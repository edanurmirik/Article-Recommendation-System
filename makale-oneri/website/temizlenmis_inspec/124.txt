high speed cmos circuit parallel dynamic logic speed enhance skewed 
	 static logic 
 paper describe parallel dynamic logic pdl exhibit high 
	 speed charge sharing problem pdl use parallel connect 
	 transistor fast logic evaluation good candidate 
	 high speed low voltage operation bias effect compare 
	 logic style use stack transistor furthermore pdl 
	 need signal ordering tapering pdl speed enhance skewed 
	 static logic render straightforward logic synthesis usual 
	 area penalty logic duplication experimental result 
	 32 bit carry lookahead adder use 0.25- mu m cmos technology 
	 pdl speed enhance skewed static sss look reduce delay 
	 clock delayed(cd)-domino 15%-27 power delay product 
	 20%-37
