modular visual specification hybrid system introduction hycharts 
 visual description technique particularly important design 
	 hybrid system specification system usually 
	 discuss engineer number different discipline 
	 modularity vital hybrid system allow 
	 handle large system permit think term 
	 component familiar engineer base different 
	 interpretation hierarchic graph clear hybrid computation 
	 model develop hycharts hycharts consist modular visual 
	 formalism specification architecture 
	 specification behavior hybrid system operator 
	 hierarchic graph enable surprisingly simple denotational 
	 semantic concept know statechart like formalism 
	 general composition operator hycharts easily compose 
	 description technique engineering discipline 
	 heterogeneous system specification particularly appropriate 
	 hybrid system interdisciplinary character
