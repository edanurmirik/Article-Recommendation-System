digital stochastic realization complex analog controller 
 stochastic logic base digital processing random pulse stream 
	 information codify probability high level 
	 finite sequence binary pulse sequence digitally process 
	 exploit similarity boolean algebra statistical 
	 algebra random pulse sequence boolean operation 
	 individual pulse correspond algebraic expression 
	 variable represent respective average pulse rate 
	 subsequently pulse stream digitally process perform 
	 analog operation paper propose stochastic approach 
	 digital implementation complex controller use programmable 
	 device alternative traditional digital signal processor 
	 example practical realization nonlinear dissipative 
	 controller series resonant converter present
