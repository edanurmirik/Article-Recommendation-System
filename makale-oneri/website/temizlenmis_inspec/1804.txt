module placement boundary constraint use b*-trees 
 module placement problem determine co ordinate logic module 
	 chip module overlap cost e.g. silicon 
	 area interconnection length etc optimise shorten 
	 connection input output and/or related module 
	 adjacent desire place module specific 
	 boundary chip deal boundary constraint 
	 explore feasibility condition b*-tree boundary 
	 constraint develop simulated annealing base algorithm use 
	 b*-trees unlike previous work propose algorithm guarantee 
	 feasible b*-tree boundary constraint perturbation 
	 experimental result algorithm obtain small 
	 silicon area recent work base sequence pair
