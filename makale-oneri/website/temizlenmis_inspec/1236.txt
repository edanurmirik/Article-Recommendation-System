compatibility comparison performance evaluation japanese hpf compiler 
	 use scientific application 
 lack compatibility high performance fortran hpf vender 
	 implementation dishearten scientific application user 
	 hinder development portable program parallel 
	 computing unpopular computational science community 
	 parallel programming common computer science 
	 community user like run source code parallel 
	 machine different architecture fast possible 
	 investigate compatibility source code japanese hpf 
	 compiler nec fujitsu hitachi real world application 
	 3d fluid code 2d particle code find 
	 source level compatibility japanese hpf compiler 
	 preserve effort need sustain complete 
	 compatibility evaluate parallel performance find 
	 hpf achieve good performance 3d fluid code 
	 source code 2d particle code good result 
	 obtain small number processor change 
	 original source code addition interface block
