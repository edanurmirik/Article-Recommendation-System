blind identification non stationary ma system 
 new adaptive algorithm blind identification time vary ma channel 
	 derive algorithm propose use novel system 
	 equation derive combine third- fourth order statistic 
	 output signal ma model overdetermine system 
	 equation important property solve adaptively 
	 symmetry overdetermine recursive 
	 instrumental variable type algorithm algorithm good 
	 behaviour arbitrary noisy environment good performance 
	 track time vary system
