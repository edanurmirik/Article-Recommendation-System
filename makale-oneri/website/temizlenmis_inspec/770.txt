3d visibility complex 
 visibility problem central computer graphic application 
	 common example include hide removal view computation 
	 shadow boundary mutual visibility object lighting 
	 simulation paper present theoretical study 3d 
	 visibility property scene smooth convex object work 
	 space light ray precisely maximal free segment 
	 group segment object define 3d 
	 visibility complex boundary group segment 
	 correspond visual event scene limit shadow 
	 disappearance object viewpoint etc 
	 provide bad case analysis complexity visibility 
	 complex 3d scene probabilistic study simple 
	 assumption normal scene extend visibility complex 
	 handle temporal visibility output sensitive construction 
	 algorithm present application approach
