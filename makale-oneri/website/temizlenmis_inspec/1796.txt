taylor series base dimensional digital differentiator 
 new type taylor series base 2 d finite difference approximation 
	 present coefficient 
	 approximation unique explicit formula present 
	 possible set coefficient arbitrary order 
	 extend previously present 1 d approximation 
	 coefficient implement maximally linear 2 d fir digital 
	 differentiator formula modify narrow 
	 inaccuracy region resultant frequency response close 
	 nyquist frequency
