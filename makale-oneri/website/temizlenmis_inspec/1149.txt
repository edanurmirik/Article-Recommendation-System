	 electron accelerator target base deterministic solution 
	 boltzmann equation couple electron photon transport 
	 dimensional 1 d slab geometry deterministic 
	 method similar result monte carlo calculation 
	 angular range interest therapy application relative energy 
	 spectra compute deterministic 3 d monte carlo method 
	 respectively compare realistic target material 
	 different electron beam find similar photon energy 
	 distribution mean energy deterministic calculation 
	 typically require 1 2 min execution time sun workstation 
	 compare 2 36 h monte carlo run
