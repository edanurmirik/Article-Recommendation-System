fractal dimension information system exact set infinite 
	 information system 
 notion exact rough set ground basic 
	 notion rough set theory define setting 
	 finite information system i.e. information system finite 
	 number object attribute theoretical study e.g. 
	 topological property rough set trespass 
	 limitation consider information system potentially unbound 
	 number attribute setting notion rough exact 
	 set define term topological operator interior 
	 closure respect appropriate topology follow idea 
	 finite case notice finite case 
	 rough set theoretic operator low upper approximation 
	 identical interior respectively closure operator 
	 topology induce equivalence class indiscernibility 
	 relation extension finite information system desirable 
	 application point view area knowledge discovery 
	 datum mining demand e.g. mass collaboration and/or huge 
	 experimental datum need work large data table 
	 sound theoretical generalization case information 
	 system number attribute bind advance fix 
	 integer i.e. information system countably infinitely 
	 attribute large information system need arise qualitative 
	 measure complexity concept involve free parameter cf 
	 e.g. application vapnik czervonenkis dimension study 
	 theoretical setting infinite information system proposal 
	 apply fractal dimension suitably modify measure concept 
	 complexity
