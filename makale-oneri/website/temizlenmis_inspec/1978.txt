multilayere image representation application image compression 
 main contribution work new paradigm image representation 
	 image compression describe new multilayere representation 
	 technique image image parse superposition 
	 coherent layer piecewise smooth region layer texture layer etc 
	 multilayere decomposition algorithm consist cascade 
	 compression apply successively image 
	 residual result previous compression 
	 iteration algorithm code residual lossy way 
	 retain significant structure residual 
	 result sparse representation layer encode 
	 independently different transform basis different 
	 bitrate combination compress layer 
	 reconstruct meaningful way strength multilayer 
	 approach come fact different set basis function 
	 complement basis function 
	 reasonable account large trend datum 
	 catch local transient oscillatory pattern 
	 multilayere representation lot beautiful application 
	 image understanding image video coding implement 
	 algorithm study capability
