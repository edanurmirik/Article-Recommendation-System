lossy spice model produce realistic average simulation 
 previous average model state space averaging technique switch 
	 waveform analysis usually apply perfect element 
	 non inclusive ohmic loss element play 
	 active role dc transfer function affect small signal 
	 ac analysis introduce damp effect model 
	 introduce boost voltage mode application
