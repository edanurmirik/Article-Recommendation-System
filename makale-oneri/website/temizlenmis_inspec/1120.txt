effective feedback control mechanism diffserv architecture 
 scalable qos quality service architecture diffserv differentiated 
	 service mainly consist component traffic conditioning 
	 edge diffserv domain simple packet forwarding inside 
	 diffserv domain diffserv advantage flexibility 
	 scalability simplicity provide af assured forwarding 
	 service diffserv problem unfairness 
	 aggregate flow micro flow belong aggregated flow 
	 paper feedback mechanism af aggregate flow propose 
	 solve problem simulation result mechanism 
	 improve performance diffserv improve fairness 
	 aggregated flow diffserv friendly tcp 
	 transmission control protocol flow second decrease 
	 buffer requirement congested router obtain low delay 
	 packet loss rate link utility 
	 normal diffserv finally simple easy implement
