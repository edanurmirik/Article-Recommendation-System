generalized mosaicing wide field view multispectral imaging 
 present approach significantly enhance spectral resolution 
	 imaging system generalize image mosaicing filter transmit 
	 spatially vary spectral band rigidly attach camera 
	 system sense scene point multiple time time 
	 different spectral band additional dimension 
	 generalize mosaic paradigm demonstrate yield high 
	 radiometric dynamic range image wide field view use 
	 spatially vary density filter result mosaic represent 
	 spectrum scene point image acquisition easy 
	 traditional image mosaic derive efficient scene sampling rate 
	 use registration method accommodate spatially varying 
	 property filter use datum acquire method 
	 demonstrate scene render different simulated illumination 
	 spectra able infer information scene 
	 illumination approach test use standard 8 bit 
	 black white video camera fix spatially vary spectral 
	 interference filter
