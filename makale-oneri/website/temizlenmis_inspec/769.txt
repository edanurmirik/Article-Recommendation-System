permission grid practical error bound simplification 
 introduce permission grid spatial occupancy grid use 
	 guide standard polygonal surface simplification algorithm 
	 generate approximation guarantee geometric error 
	 bind particular point approximation guarantee 
	 user specify distance original surface 
	 bound notably absent current simplification method 
	 increasingly important application scientific 
	 computing adaptive level detail control conceptually simple 
	 permission grid define volume approximation 
	 lie permit underlie simplification algorithm 
	 generate approximation outside volume permission grid 
	 important practical improvement current error bound 
	 simplification method work arbitrary triangular model 
	 handle manner mesh degeneracy gracefully far 
	 error tolerance easily expand simplification proceed 
	 allow construction error bound level detail hierarchy 
	 vertex correspondence level detail finally 
	 permission grid representation complexity independent 
	 size input model small running time overhead 
	 practical efficient current method similar 
	 guarantee
