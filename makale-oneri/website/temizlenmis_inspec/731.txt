aggregate bandwidth estimation store video distribution system 
 multimedia application like video demand distance learning internet video 
	 broadcast etc play fundamental role future broadband 
	 network common aspect application transmission 
	 video stream require sustained relatively high bandwidth 
	 stringent requirement quality service paper 
	 original algorithm evaluate video distribution system 
	 statistical estimation aggregate bandwidth need number 
	 smoothed video stream propose discuss variable bit 
	 rate traffic generate video stream characterize 
	 marginal distribution conditional probability rate 
	 temporary closed stream develop iterative algorithm evaluate 
	 upper low bind need bandwidth guarantee 
	 loss probability obtain result compare simulation 
	 result base similar assumption present 
	 literature consideration developed algorithm 
	 order evaluate effectiveness propose method
