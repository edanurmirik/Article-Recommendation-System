 multiecho segment epi z shim background gradient compensation 
	 mesbac pulse sequence propose validate functional mri 
	 fmri study region suffer severe susceptibility artifact 
	 sequence provide effective tradeoff spatial 
	 temporal resolution reduce image distortion signal dropout 
	 blood oxygenation level dependent bold)-weighte fmri signal 
	 reliably obtain region orbitofrontal cortex ofc 
	 overcome physiological motion artifact prolong 
	 multisegment epi acquisition set navigator echo 
	 acquire readout phase encoding direction ghost 
	 artifact generally produce single shot epi acquisition 
	 eliminate separately place odd echo different 
	 k space trajectory unlike z shim method focus 
	 increase temporal resolution event relate functional brain 
	 mapping mesbac sequence simultaneously address problem image 
	 distortion signal dropout maintain sufficient temporal 
	 resolution mesbac sequence particularly useful 
	 pharmacological affective fmri study brain region 
	 ofc nucleus accumben amygdala para hippocampus etc
