distribute server approach large scale secure multicast 
 order offer backward forward secrecy multicast application 
	 i.e. new member decrypt multicast datum send 
	 joining member decrypt datum send 
	 leaving data encryption key change user 
	 join leave system change known 
	 current user bandwidth use key messaging 
	 high user pool large propose distribute server 
	 approach minimize overall system bandwidth complexity 
	 split user pool multiple group serve logical 
	 server present analytic model system base 
	 hierarchical key tree optimal number 
	 server achieve minimum system bandwidth underlie user 
	 traffic fluctuate propose simple dynamic scheme low 
	 overhead physical server adaptively split merge 
	 traffic multiple group serve logical server 
	 minimize total bandwidth result distribute 
	 server approach able substantially reduce total bandwidth 
	 require compare traditional single server approach 
	 especially application large user pool short holding 
	 time relatively low bandwidth data stream internet 
	 stock quote application
