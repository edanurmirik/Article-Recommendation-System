novel approach detection pathline x ray angiogram 
	 wavefront propagation algorithm 
 present new pathline approach base wavefront propagation principle 
	 develop order reduce variability outcome 
	 quantitative coronary artery analysis novel approach 
	 wavepath reduce influence user define start- 
	 endpoint vessel segment robust 
	 improve reproducibility lesion quantification 
	 substantially validation study wavepath method 
	 totally constant middle pathline use 
	 method construct bifurcation sidebranch pathline 
	 furthermore number correction need guide wavepath 
	 correct vessel decrease average 0.44 
	 correction pathline average 0.12 pathline 
	 conclude wavepath algorithm improve overall 
	 analysis substantially
