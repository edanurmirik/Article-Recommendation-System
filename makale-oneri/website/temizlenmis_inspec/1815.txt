control integral process dead time 1 disturbance observer base 2 
	 dof control scheme 
 disturbance observer base control scheme version 2 dof internal model 
	 control effective control integral process 
	 dead time present controller design reject ramp 
	 disturbance step disturbance arbitrary 
	 disturbance plant model available parameter 
	 leave tune time constant set point response 
	 time constant disturbance response 
	 tune accord compromise disturbance response 
	 robustness control scheme simple clear easy design 
	 easy implement structure good performance compare 
	 good result far use simulation example
