operation disturb partially know quantum state 
 consider situation quantum system secretly prepare state 
	 choose know set state present principle 
	 definite distinction operation preserve state 
	 system disturb state principle 
	 derive alternately apply fundamental property classical 
	 signal fundamental property quantum principle 
	 cast simple form use decomposition relevant 
	 hilbert space uniquely determine set possible 
	 state decomposition imply classification degree 
	 freedom system depend store 
	 information initially choose state store classically 
	 store nonclassically store 
	 information principle state nonclassical 
	 inaccessible classical read preserve 
	 state system principle type cloning 
	 broadcasting imprinting condition easily derive 
	 general form include mixed state unified view 
	 scheme quantum cryptography work principle help 
	 derive optimum resource bit qubit ebit 
	 require datum compression quantum teleportation mixed state 
	 ensemble
