text independent speaker verification use utterance level scoring 
	 covariance modeling 
 paper describe computationally simple method perform text 
	 independent speaker verification use second order statistic 
	 suggest method utterance level scoring uls allow 
	 obtain normalize score use single pass frame 
	 test utterance utterance sample covariance calculate 
	 compare speaker covariance use distortion measure 
	 subsequently distortion measure utterance covariance 
	 sample covariance datum different speaker use 
	 normalize score experimental result 2000 nist speaker 
	 recognition evaluation present uls use different 
	 distortion measure gaussian mixture model gmm system 
	 result indicate uls viable alternative gmm 
	 computational complexity verification accuracy need trade
