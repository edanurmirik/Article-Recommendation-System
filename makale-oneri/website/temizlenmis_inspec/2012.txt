strain contour use gabor filter principle algorithm 
 moire interferometry powerful technique high sensitivity plane 
	 deformation contouring engineering viewpoint 
	 derivative displacement i.e. strain desire parameter 
	 need differentiate displacement field optical 
	 digital method propose differentiation 
	 optical method provide contour need quantify 
	 digital method suffer drawback inherent digital 
	 differentiation process describe novel approach strain 
	 segmentation moire pattern use multichannel gabor filter 
	 appropriate filter design allow user specific segmentation 
	 essentially engineering design analysis
