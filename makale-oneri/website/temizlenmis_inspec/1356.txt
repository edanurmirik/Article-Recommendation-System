 milling rule surface use conical milling cutter study 
	 field largely ignore research scientist 
	 use industry especially machine turbine blade 
	 suggest improved positioning respect 
	 directrice rule surface compare method 
	 develop cylindrical cutter positioning enable 
	 error cutter work piece reduce algorithm 
	 introduce calculate error determine cutter 
	 dimension cone radius angle order respect tolerance 
	 interval impose design office study provide 
	 opportunity determine cutter great dimension 
	 alleviate bend problem milling
