post project runge kutta method index-2 differential algebraic equation 
 new projection technique runge kutta method apply index-2 
	 differential algebraic equation present numerical 
	 approximation project output process 
	 method strictly stable infinity order 
	 convergence unaffected compare standard project method 
	 gauss method technique special interest 
	 symmetry preserve study detail
