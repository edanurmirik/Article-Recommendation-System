 paper propose new method estimate vanish point use 
	 vehicle heading essential automatic driving system 
	 propose method use cross ratio comprise ratio length 
	 collinear point extract edge shape vanish 
	 point line intersect point fit edge 
	 hough space consequently vanish point estimate 
	 robustly lane marking occlude vehicle 
	 presence lane marking road boundary estimate 
	 time experimental result image real road scene 
	 effectiveness propose method
