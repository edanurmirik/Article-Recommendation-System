improve frequency stability microwave oscillator utilize 
	 dual mode sapphire load cavity resonator 
 design experimental testing novel control circuit stabilize 
	 temperature sapphire load cavity whisper gallery 
	 resonator oscillator improve medium term frequency stability 
	 present finite element software use predict frequency 
	 quality factor wge sub 7,0,0/ wgh sub 9,0,0/ mode near 9 
	 ghz separate frequency approximately 80 mhz calculation 
	 novel temperature control circuit difference 
	 frequency result frequency stability 
	 10 sup 13/ 270 k. present detail good way 
	 couple orthogonally mode similar frequency different 
	 polarization
