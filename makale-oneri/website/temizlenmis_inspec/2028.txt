centroid detection base optical correlation 
 propose correlation base method simultaneously detect 
	 centroid multiple object input scene method 
	 base modulus moment function second method base 
	 square moment function method work 
	 single intensity filter method invariant change 
	 position orientation scale object result good 
	 noise smooth performance use spatial light modulator slms 
	 directly implement input image filter information 
	 purpose approach present result simulation 
	 different approach provide comparison 
	 optical correlation- digital moment base method experimental 
	 result correspond optical correlator use slm 
	 centroid detection present
