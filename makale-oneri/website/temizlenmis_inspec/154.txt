verify concurrent system symbolic execution 
 current technique interactively prove temporal property concurrent 
	 system translate transition system temporal formula 
	 introduce program counter variable proof intuitive 
	 control flow explicitly consider sequential 
	 program symbolic execution intuitive interactive proof 
	 strategy paper adopt technique parallel program 
	 property formulate interval temporal logic implementation 
	 interactive theorem prover kiv technique 
	 offer high degree automation allow simple local invariant
