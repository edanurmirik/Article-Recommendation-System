surface texture improve robustness stereoscopic depth cue 
 research develop design recommendation surface texture pattern 
	 color object surface render stereoscopic display 3 
	 method adjustment procedure experiment 8 participant match 
	 disparity circular probe planar stimulus render use 
	 single visible edge experiment varied stimulus orientation 
	 surface texture participant accurately match depth 
	 vertical stimulus horizontal stimulus consistent 
	 previous study exist theory participant match depth 
	 surface large pixel pixel luminance variation accurately 
	 surface small pixel pixel luminance variation 
	 finally match depth surface vertical line pattern 
	 accurately surface horizontal stripe texture 
	 pattern result suggest designer enhance depth 
	 perception stereoscopic display reduce undesirable 
	 sensitivity orientation render object surface texture 
	 use large pixel pixel luminance variation
