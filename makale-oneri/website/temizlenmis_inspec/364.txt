maclp multi agent constraint logic programming 
 multi agent system mas key technology decompose 
	 complex problem order solve efficiently 
	 problem distribute nature industrial application 
	 distribute nature involve large number 
	 parameter constraint i.e. combinatorial solve 
	 particularly hard problem efficiently require programming tool 
	 combine mas technology programming schema facilitate 
	 modeling solution constraint paper present maclp multi 
	 agent constraint logic programming logic programming platform 
	 building declarative way multi agent system 
	 constraint solve capability maclp extend cspcons logic 
	 programming system permit distribute program execution 
	 communicate sequential prolog process constraint 
	 provide necessary facility communication 
	 agent facility abstract programmer low level 
	 detail communication allow focus development
