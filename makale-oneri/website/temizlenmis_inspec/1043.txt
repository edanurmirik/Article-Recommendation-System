fractional motion control application xy cutting table 
 path tracking design dynamic actuator account 
	 order reduce overshoot appear small displacement new 
	 approach path tracking use fractional differentiation propose 
	 application xy cutting table permit generation 
	 optimal movement reference input lead minimum path 
	 completion time account maximum velocity 
	 acceleration torque bandwidth closed loop system 
	 fractional differentiation use davidson cole filter 
	 methodology aim improve accuracy especially 
	 checkpoint present reference input obtain compare 
	 spline function apply xy cutting table model 
	 actuator output compare
