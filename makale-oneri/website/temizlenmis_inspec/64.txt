speech enhancement use mixture maximum model 
 present spectral domain speech enhancement algorithm new algorithm 
	 base mixture model short time spectrum clean 
	 speech signal maximum assumption production 
	 noisy speech spectrum past model use context 
	 noise robust speech recognition paper 
	 model effective improve quality speech signal 
	 corrupt additive noise computational requirement 
	 algorithm significantly reduce essentially pay 
	 performance penalty incorporate dual codebook scheme 
	 tie variance experiment use record speech signal actual 
	 noise source spite low computational 
	 requirement algorithm improved performance compare 
	 alternative speech enhancement algorithm
