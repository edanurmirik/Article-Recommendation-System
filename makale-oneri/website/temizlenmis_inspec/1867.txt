optimization base design fix order controller command follow 
 discrete time scalar system propose approach design feedback 
	 controller fix order minimize upper bind peak 
	 magnitude tracking error command input work 
	 use linear programming design class closed loop 
	 system propose rejection non zero initial condition 
	 bound disturbance incorporate performance robustness form 
	 guarantee upper bind peak magnitude tracking error 
	 plant coprime factor uncertainty
