	 application 
 use plane strain theory transversely isotropic body study 
	 piezoelectric cantilever order find general solution 
	 density functionally gradient piezoelectric cantilever use 
	 inverse method i.e. airy stress function method 
	 obtain stress induction function form polynomial 
	 general solution beam base general 
	 solution deduce solution cantilever 
	 different loading condition furthermore application 
	 general solution engineering study tip deflection 
	 block force piezoelectric cantilever actuator finally 
	 address method determine density distribution profile 
	 piezoelectric material
