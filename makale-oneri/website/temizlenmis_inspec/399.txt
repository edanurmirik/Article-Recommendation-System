low voltage dram sensing scheme offset cancellation sense amplifier 
 novel bitline sense scheme propose low voltage dram achieve low 
	 power dissipation compatibility low voltage cmos 
	 major obstacle low voltage dram degradation 
	 data retention time low signal level memory cell 
	 require power consume refresh operation frequently paper 
	 propose offset cancellation sense amplifier scheme ocsa 
	 improve data retention time significantly low supply voltage 
	 improve die efficiency propose scheme reduce 
	 number sense amplifier support cell sense 
	 amplifier measurement data retention time 
	 propose scheme 1.5 v supply voltage 2.4 time 
	 conventional scheme 2.0 v
