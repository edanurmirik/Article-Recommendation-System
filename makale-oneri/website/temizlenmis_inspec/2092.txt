match pet ct scan head neck area development method 
	 validation 
 positron emission tomography pet provide important information tumor 
	 biology lack detailed anatomical information aim 
	 present study develop validate automatic registration 
	 method match pet ct scan head neck 
	 difficulty achieve goal 1 nonrigid motion 
	 neck hamper use automatic ridged body transformation 2 
	 emission scan contain little anatomical information apply 
	 standard image fusion method 3 objective way exist 
	 quantify quality match result problem solve 
	 follow accurate reproducible positioning patient 
	 achieve use radiotherapy treatment mask propose method 
	 use transmission emission scan obtain 
	 sufficient anatomical information matching bed position 
	 transmission scan include protocol mutual 
	 information base algorithm use registration technique pet 
	 ct datum obtain seven patient patient ct 
	 scan pet scan dataset use estimate 
	 consistency match pet ct sub 1/ ct sub 1/ ct sub 2/ 
	 ct sub 2/ pet use circle consistency test find 
	 use method consistency obtain 4 mm 1.3 
	 degree average pet voxel use registration 5.15 mm 
	 error compare favorably voxel size crop 
	 image remove scanner bed image improve 
	 consistency algorithm transmission scan 
	 potentially reduce single position use approach 
	 conclusion represent algorithm validation technique 
	 feature attractive theoretical 
	 practical point view user independent automatic validation 
	 technique match ct pet scan head neck 
	 opportunity compare different image enhancement
