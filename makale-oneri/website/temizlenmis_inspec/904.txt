	 transfer mode network 
 article present modeling simulation methodology analyze 
	 performance voice quality send available bit rate 
	 service asynchronous transfer mode network source modify 
	 rate send traffic network base feedback 
	 carry resource management cell achieve change 
	 encoding level contention increase network 
	 resource bandwidth case source start reduce rate 
	 generate send traffic efficiency scheme 
	 different scheduling drop policy operating condition 
	 environment evaluate use simulation modeling furthermore 
	 sensitivity analysis apply different parameter queue 
	 size average interval length investigate impact 
	 performance metric result limit load 41 
	 link capacity result acceptable quality
