use devs formalism operationalize elp model diagnosis sachem 
 paper describe original approach discrete event control 
	 continuous process mean expert knowledge present 
	 application approach sachem diagnosis subsystem 
	 sachem system large scale knowledge base system aim 
	 help set operator control dynamic complex 
	 continuous system e.g. blast furnace propose method base 
	 definition language facilitate acquisition 
	 representation expert knowledge elp expert language 
	 process ii use devs formalism elp model 
	 operational iii algorithms exploit operational model
