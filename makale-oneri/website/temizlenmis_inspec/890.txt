multiple criterion decision optimization 
 present development intend interactive decision scheme 
	 accessible wide spectrum decision maker aim 
	 propose eliminate need solve optimization problem 
	 successive iteration interactive decision process 
	 need optimization eliminate ability 
	 establish sufficiently tight bound criterion value efficient 
	 decision prior explicit identification decision 
	 present technique fully operational numerically simple 
	 establish bound bound dynamic i.e. 
	 strong grow number decision explicitly identify 
	 parametric respect weight coefficient 
	 point technique enhance exist interactive 
	 decision making method
