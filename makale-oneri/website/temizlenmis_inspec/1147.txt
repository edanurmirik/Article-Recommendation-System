 emission tune aperture compute tomography etact previously 
	 potential detection small tumor 1 cm 
	 scintimammography optimal approach application 
	 etact clinic determine seek 
	 determine effect angular disparity etact 
	 projection image quality use computer simulation 
	 small spherical tumor variable size 5 7.5 10 mm place 
	 center hemispherical breast 15 cm diameter tumor 
	 nontumor ratio 5:1 10:1 detector model 
	 gamma camera fit 4 mm diam pinhole collimator 
	 pinhole detector pinhole tumor distance 25 15 
	 cm respectively ray tracing technique use generate 
	 set projection 10 degree 15 degree 20 degree angular 
	 disparity datum blur resolution consistent 
	 4 mm pinhole tact reconstruction method use reconstruct 
	 image set tumor contrast axial spatial 
	 resolution measure small angular disparity lead 
	 improvement image contrast cost degraded axial spatial 
	 resolution improvement contrast slight improvement 
	 plane spatial resolution improve contrast lead 
	 tumor detectability small angular disparity 
	 use difference contrast 10 degree 15 
	 degree slight reasonable clinical choice 
	 angular disparity 15 degree
