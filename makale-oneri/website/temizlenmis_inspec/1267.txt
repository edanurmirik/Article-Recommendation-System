3d reconstruction uncalibrated camera optical flow reliability 
	 evaluation 
 present scheme reconstruct 3d structure optical flow 
	 observe camera unknown focal length statistically 
	 optimal way evaluate reliability compute 
	 shape flow fundamental matrix optimally compute 
	 observe flow decompose focal length 
	 rate change motion parameter flow optimally 
	 correct satisfy epipolar equation exactly finally 
	 3d position compute covariance matrix 
	 evaluate simulation real image experiment test 
	 performance system observe normalization gauge 
	 remove indeterminacy affect description uncertainty
