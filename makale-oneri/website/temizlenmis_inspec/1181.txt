dynamic neighborhood structure parallel evolution strategy 
 parallelizing straightforward approach reduce total computation 
	 time evolutionary algorithm find appropriate communication 
	 network spatially structured population improve 
	 convergence speed convergence probability difficult task 
	 new method use dynamic communication scheme evolution 
	 strategy compare conventional static dynamic 
	 approach communication structure base 
	 diffusion model approach link adjacent individual 
	 dynamically choose accord deterministic probabilistic rule 
	 self organization effect efficient stable communication 
	 structure establish perform robustly quickly 
	 multimodal test function
