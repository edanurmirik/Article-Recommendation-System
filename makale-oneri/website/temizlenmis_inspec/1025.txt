watermarke technique electronic delivery remote sensing image 
 earth observation mission recently attract grow interest mainly 
	 large number possible application capable exploit 
	 remotely sense datum image increase market 
	 potential need arise protection image product 
	 need crucial internet 
	 public private network preferred mean datum exchange 
	 critical issue arise deal digital image distribution 
	 copyright protection problem largely address 
	 resort watermarke technology question obviously arise 
	 requirement impose remote sensing imagery 
	 compatible exist watermarking technique basis 
	 motivation contribution work twofold assessment 
	 requirement impose remote sensing application 
	 watermark base copyright protection modification 
	 establish digital watermarking technique meet 
	 constraint specifically concept near lossless 
	 watermarking introduce possible algorithm match 
	 requirement present experimental result measure 
	 impact watermark introduction typical remote sensing 
	 application i.e. unsupervise image classification
