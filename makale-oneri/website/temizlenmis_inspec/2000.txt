generalized predictive control non uniformly sample system 
 paper study digital control system non uniform updating 
	 sample pattern include multirate sample datum system 
	 special case derive lift model state space domain 
	 main obstacle generalized predictive control gpc design use 
	 lift model causality constraint 
	 account design constraint propose new gpc algorithm 
	 result optimal causal control law non uniformly sample 
	 system solution apply immediately multirate sample data 
	 system rate integer multiple base period
