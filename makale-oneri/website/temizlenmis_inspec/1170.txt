upper bind analysis oblique cutting nose radius tool 
 generalized upper bind model calculate chip flow angle oblique 
	 cut use flat face nose radius tool describe projection 
	 uncut chip area rake face divide number 
	 element parallel assumed chip flow direction length 
	 element use find length corresponding 
	 element shear surface use ratio shear velocity 
	 chip velocity area element find cross 
	 product length width cutting edge sum 
	 area element shear surface total shear 
	 surface area obtain friction area calculate use 
	 similarity orthogonal oblique cutting equivalent 
	 plane include cut velocity chip velocity 
	 cutting power obtain sum shear power friction 
	 power actual chip flow angle chip velocity obtain 
	 minimize cutting power respect variable 
	 shape curved shear surface chip cross section 
	 cut force obtain model present
