 paper new concept payoff switch differential game 
	 introduce new game player time 
	 choice payoff future 
	 payoff switch process include time payoff switching 
	 outcome payoff player unknown 
	 overall payoff sequence payoff unknown 
	 game end algorithm determine reasoning strategy 
	 base fuzzy reasoning propose algorithm fuzzy 
	 theory use estimate behavior player past 
	 time interval derive fuzzy matrix gsm game similarity 
	 matrix vgsm variation gsm behavior player 
	 quantify weighting vector select weight relative 
	 importance player behavior past time instant finally 
	 simple fuzzy inference rule adopt generate linear reasoning 
	 strategy advantage algorithm provide 
	 flexible way differential game specialist convert 
	 knowledge reasonable strategy practical example guard 
	 territory illustrate main idea
