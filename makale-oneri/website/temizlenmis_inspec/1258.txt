implementation performance evaluation fifo queue class library 
	 time warp 
 author describe implementation use performance evaluation 
	 fifo queue class library mean high performance easy use 
	 interface employ queue simulation parallel discrete 
	 simulation base time warp method general purpose 
	 simulation library language propose 
	 advantage require user define 
	 state vector need awareness rollback 
	 platform perform state control base copy 
	 state vector define simple datum structure 
	 pointer dynamic data structure fifo queue 
	 handle directly propose class library platform 
	 user handle structure fashion 
	 embed datum structure handle addition instead 
	 store datum operational history store recover 
	 efficiently effectively minimal cost advantage 
	 characteristic data structure 
	 kernel delete past state history simulation garbage 
	 collection perform transparently use corresponding 
	 method
