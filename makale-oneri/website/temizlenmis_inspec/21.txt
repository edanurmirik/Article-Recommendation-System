discrete output feedback slide mode control second order system 
	 switch line approach 
 slide mode control system smcs switch variable 
	 design independent initial condition know 
	 sensitive parameter variation extraneous disturbance 
	 reach phase second order system drawback 
	 eliminate use switch line technique 
	 switch line initially design pass initial condition 
	 subsequently predetermine switching line 
	 paper use idea switch line 
	 reach law approach design discrete output feedback 
	 slide mode control main contribution work 
	 require use system state use 
	 output sample design controller use 
	 switch line low sensitivity system obtain shortening 
	 reach phase simulation result fast output 
	 sample feedback guarantee slide motion similar obtain 
	 use state feedback
