experimental investigation monitoring control induction heating 
	 process semi solid alloy use heating coil sensor 
 method monitor state metal alloy induction heating 
	 control heating process utilize heating coil 
	 sensor propose usefulness effectiveness 
	 experimentally investigate use aluminium a357 billet 
	 semi solid metal ssm casting process impedance coil 
	 contain billet continuously measure propose method 
	 temperature range room temperature 700 degree c. 
	 find reactance component impedance vary 
	 distinctively accord billet state clearly monitor 
	 deformation billet resistance component increase 
	 temperature reflect variation resistivity 
	 billet strong correlation solid liquid fraction 
	 billet measured impedance sensitive billet state 
	 temperature deformation solid liquid fraction 
	 use parameter monitor control heating process ssms
