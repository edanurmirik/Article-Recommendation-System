self adjust quality service control scheme 
 propose analyze self adjust quality service qos control scheme 
	 goal optimize system reward result servicing 
	 different priority client vary workload qos 
	 reward penalty requirement scheme base resource 
	 partition designate degrade qos area system 
	 resource partition priority area reserve 
	 specifically serve client corresponding class qos 
	 degradation plus degraded qos area client 
	 admit qos adjustment apply low priority 
	 client good partition dictate workload 
	 reward penalty characteristic client difference 
	 priority class analysis result use qos manager 
	 optimize system total reward dynamically response change 
	 workload run time demonstrate validity scheme 
	 mean simulation compare propose qos self adjusting 
	 scheme use resource partitioning designate 
	 degraded qos area
