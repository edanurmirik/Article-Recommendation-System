shy invariant graph 
 know result p.l. hammer et al 1982 introduce 
	 new graph invariant lambda g refer graph g. 
	 non negative integer non zero g contain particular 
	 induce odd cycle equivalently admit particular minimum 
	 clique partition that).(g efficiently evaluate 
	 determination allow reduce hard problem 
	 compute minimum clique cover graph identical problem 
	 small size special structure furthermore alpha g 
	 or= theta g lambda g alpha g theta g 
	 respectively denote cardinality maximum stable set g 
	 minimum clique partition g
