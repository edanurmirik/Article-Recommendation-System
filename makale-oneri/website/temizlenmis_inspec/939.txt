image reconstruction fan beam projection short scan 
 work concern 2d image reconstruction fan beam projection 
	 exact stable reconstruction 
	 region interest object require line pass 
	 object measure complete non truncated fan beam 
	 projection provide sufficient information reconstruction 
	 line pass region interest intersect 
	 vertex path non tangential way practical implication 
	 condition discuss new filter backprojection 
	 algorithm derive reconstruction experiment 
	 computer simulate datum perform support mathematical 
	 result
