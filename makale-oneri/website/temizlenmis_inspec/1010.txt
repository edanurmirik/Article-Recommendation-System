robust self tune pid controller nonlinear system 
 paper propose robust self tune pid controller suitable 
	 nonlinear system control system employ preload relay p_relay 
	 series pid controller p_relay ensure high gain 
	 yield robust performance incur chatter 
	 phenomenon paper instead view chattering 
	 undesirable inevitable feature use naturally occur 
	 signal tune tune pid controller operating 
	 regime digresse explicit input signal require 
	 pid controller tune particular operating point relay 
	 disabled chatter cease correspondingly 
	 invoke change setpoint operate regime 
	 way approach applicable time vary system 
	 pid tuning continuous base late set chattering 
	 characteristic analysis provide stability property 
	 control scheme simulation result level control fluid 
	 spherical tank use scheme present
