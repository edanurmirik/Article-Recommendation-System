 paper finite element linear quadratic regulator lqr vibration 
	 control smart piezoelectric composite plate propose use 
	 total weight energy method select weighting matrix 
	 construct optimal performance function relative measure 
	 total kinetic energy strain energy input energy system 
	 design variable need consider achieve balance 
	 desire high damp effect low input cost modal 
	 control analysis use interpret effect energy 
	 weight factor damp ratio modal voltage 
	 modal damp effect increase kinetic energy 
	 weight factor approach square root 2/2 strain energy 
	 weight factor increase decrease input energy weight 
	 factor numerical result agree modal control 
	 analysis control problem simplify design 
	 variable computational cost greatly reduce 
	 accurate structural control analysis attractive 
	 large system
