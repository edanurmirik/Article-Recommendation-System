wavelet base level detail representation 3d object 
 paper propose 3d object lod level detail model system 
	 construct mesh range image generate mesh 
	 lod use wavelet transform initial mesh 
	 generation use marching cube algorithm modify original 
	 algorithm apply construct mesh multiple range image 
	 efficiently base mesh use decimation algorithm 
	 simplify mesh preserve topology finally 
	 reconstruct new mesh similar initial mesh calculate 
	 wavelet coefficient use wavelet transform solve 
	 critical problem wavelet base method surface crease problem 
	 use mesh simplification base mesh generation method
