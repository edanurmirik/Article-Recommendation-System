robust kalman filter design discrete time delay system 
 problem finite- infinite horizon robust kalman filtering 
	 uncertain discrete time system state delay address 
	 system consideration subject time vary norm bound 
	 parameter uncertainty state output matrix develop 
	 new methodology design linear filter error 
	 variance filter guarantee certain upper bind 
	 allow uncertainty time delay solution 
	 term riccati equation multiple time delay system 
	 investigate
