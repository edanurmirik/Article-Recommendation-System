 paper automatically reconstruct 3d surface 
	 object observe motion single static camera base 
	 paradigm structure motion linear intensity subspace 
	 introduce geotensity constraint govern relationship 
	 image object 
	 possible theory solve 3d lambertian surface structure 
	 case single point light source propose solution exist 
	 arbitrary number point light source surface 
	 texture example automatic surface 
	 reconstruction face point light source use arbitrary 
	 unknown object motion single fix camera
