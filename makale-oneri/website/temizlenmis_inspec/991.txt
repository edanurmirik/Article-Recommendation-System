estimation block probability cellular network dynamic channel 
	 assignment 
 blocking probability cellular mobile communication network use dynamic 
	 channel assignment hard compute realistic sized system 
	 computational difficulty structure state 
	 space impose strong coupling constraint component 
	 occupancy vector approximate tractable model propose 
	 product form stationary state distribution 
	 real channel assignment scheme product form poor 
	 approximation necessary simulate actual occupancy 
	 process order estimate block probability meaningful 
	 estimate block probability typically require enormous 
	 cpu time simulation block event usually 
	 rare advanced simulation approach use importance sample 
	 overcome problem study regime blocking 
	 rare event low load high cell capacity simulation use 
	 standard clock sc method low load propose change 
	 measure static issc bound relative error 
	 high capacity use change measure depend current 
	 state network occupancy dynamic issc method 
	 prove method yield zero variance estimator single 
	 clique model empirically advantage method 
	 naive simulation network moderate size traffic load
