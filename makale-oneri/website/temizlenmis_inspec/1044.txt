analogue realization fractional order controller 
 approach design analogue circuit implement fractional order 
	 controller present suggest approach base use 
	 continue fraction expansion case negative coefficient 
	 continue fraction expansion use negative impedance 
	 converter propose possible method obtain suitable 
	 rational approximation continue fraction expansion 
	 discuss example realization fractional order sup lambda 
	 controller present illustrate obtain measurement 
	 suggest approach use control fast process 
	 use digital controller difficult impossible
